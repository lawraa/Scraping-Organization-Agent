The first involves a joint R&D cooperation agreement with Argon BioMedical (6748) to advance regenerative medicine applications. The second is an NT$150 million investment in Compath Solutions Inc., leveraging translational science and artificial intelligence to enhance R&D capabilities and efficiency. Lin Chuen explained that new drug development is capital-intensive with long return periods, necessitating the development of businesses or investments that generate stable cash flow to support long-term growth. Allgenesis's investment in Compath was not for its genetic testing services, but for its core strengths in AI algorithms, precision medicine, and clinical big data integration. Compath's FDA-approved InheriNext software has begun securing orders and is expected to contribute revenue to Allgenesis starting from the third quarter. The collaboration with Argon BioMedical is structured as a ""no consideration arrangement,"" with Lin Chuen emphasizing speed in product development over protracted financial discussions like mergers and acquisitions.

The study, which included over 21,000 patients, was not a randomized controlled trial, but Novo Nordisk emphasized that semaglutide's cardiovascular protective effects are unique to its molecular structure. The research showed that patients continuously treated with 2.4 mg semaglutide experienced a 57% reduction in cardiovascular event risk compared to those using tirzepatide; even accounting for treatment interruptions, semaglutide users saw a 29% lower risk. Both treatment groups reported low rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). These findings, presented at the 2025 European Society of Cardiology Congress, are expected to bolster Novo Nordisk, which faces market share erosion by Eli Lilly's Zepbound in the U.S. Despite Wegovy's soaring sales making Novo Nordisk Europe's most valuable company, a recent global hiring freeze for non-critical positions signals slowing growth, leading the Danish government to lower its 2025 economic growth forecast. Wegovy and Zepbound dominate the weight-loss market, projected to reach $150 billion by the early 2030s. The U.S. FDA is currently reviewing a high-dose oral version of Wegovy, with approval anticipated by year-end; this oral version previously demonstrated a 15% body weight reduction in a Phase 3 trial. However, the article notes that real-world studies cannot establish causality like randomized clinical trials, and the short follow-up period limits its long-term evidential value.",2025-09-03 07:08:45

80098,https://news.gbimonthly.com/tw/article/show.php?num=80098,13億收購值得?! AZ降血壓新藥臨床三期達標、將申請藥證,2025-09-02,"AstraZeneca, CinCor, Roche",AstraZeneca,阿斯特捷利康是一家全球領先的生物製藥公司，專注於處方藥的研發、製造與銷售，涵蓋腫瘤、心血管、腎臟、代謝及呼吸道等疾病領域。,"阿斯特捷利康（AstraZeneca, AZ）於美國時間8月30日在西班牙舉行的歐洲心血管學會會議（ESCC）中宣布，其開發的高血壓藥錠baxdrostat在臨床三期試驗的高劑量組別中，展現了高達10 mmHg的降血壓效果，並將準備提交藥證申請。

這項名為BaxHTN的臨床三期試驗共招募了796名高血壓未受控制的患者，經過12週治療後，1 mg和2 mg組的安慰劑校正收縮壓下降幅度分別為8.7 mmHg和9.8 mmHg，且在非控制及頑固型亞組中結果一致。次要試驗終點也顯示，兩種劑量均帶來更佳的舒張壓降低效果，並使患者達到目標收縮壓（低於130mmHg）的比率增加兩倍。完整結果已刊登於《新英格蘭醫學期刊》。

Baxdrostat最初由CinCor向羅氏（Roche）引入授權，隨後CinCor於2023年1月被AZ以13億美元預付款收購。當時這筆交易被視為一場賭注，因baxdrostat在臨床二期試驗曾達標失敗，但現在看來AZ成功取得了顯著的優惠條件。Baxdrostat是一種醛固酮合成酶抑制劑，透過減少醛固酮來降低血壓，同時不影響皮質醇合成。AZ生物製藥研發執行副總裁Sharon Barr表示，baxdrostat具有克服難以控制高血壓的潛力，預計在幾個月內推進衛生監管法規申請。AZ目前也在評估baxdrostat在24小時門診降血壓效果、慢性腎病和預防心衰竭等其他適應症的治療潛力。","AstraZeneca (AZ) announced positive Phase III clinical trial results for its hypertension drug, baxdrostat, at the European Society of Cardiology Congress (ESCC) in Spain on August 30. The high-dose group of the trial demonstrated a blood pressure reduction of up to 10 mmHg, and AZ is now preparing to submit regulatory applications.

The BaxHTN Phase III trial enrolled 796 patients with uncontrolled hypertension. After 12 weeks of treatment, the 1 mg and 2 mg doses showed placebo-adjusted systolic blood pressure reductions of 8.7 mmHg and 9.8 mmHg, respectively, with consistent results across uncontrolled and treatment-resistant subgroups. Secondary endpoints also indicated improved diastolic blood pressure reduction and a doubled rate of patients achieving target systolic blood pressure (<130mmHg). The full results have been published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Baxdrostat was originally licensed by CinCor from Roche, and CinCor was subsequently acquired by AstraZeneca in January 2023 for a $1.3 billion upfront payment. This acquisition was initially considered a gamble as baxdrostat had recently failed to meet a key endpoint in a Phase II trial, but it now appears AZ secured favorable terms. Baxdrostat is an aldosterone synthase inhibitor that lowers blood pressure by reducing aldosterone without affecting cortisol synthesis. Sharon Barr, EVP of BioPharmaceuticals R&D at AZ, highlighted baxdrostat's potential to address difficult-to-control hypertension, with regulatory applications expected within months. AZ is also evaluating baxdrostat for other indications, including 24-hour blood pressure control, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure prevention.",2025-09-03 03:18:17

This development comes after OBI Pharma decided to terminate its previous active immunotherapy anti-cancer drug project, Adagloxad Simolenin (OBI-822)/OBI-821, for triple-negative breast cancer, following a recommendation to stop its Phase III trial by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The decision was driven by substantial R&D costs incurred in the late-stage trial and the company's strategic shift to focus on ADC development, which had led to escalating accumulated losses.

Financially, OBI Pharma reported accumulated losses of NT$7.879 billion as of December 31, 2024. To offset these losses, the board resolved to implement a capital reduction of NT$1.316 billion, cancelling 131.5 million issued common shares, representing a 50% reduction (500 shares for every 1,000 shares held). Post-reduction, the paid-in capital will be NT$1.316 billion. OBI Pharma stated that this measure aims to enhance the company's net worth and operational structure, and it will actively pursue early clinical licensing and global collaboration opportunities.

The OBI-902 Phase I clinical trial will be led by Dr. Apostolia M.

吳漢章博士在一場座談會中分享了健康數據治理的心得，指出台灣政府早於2018年就曾討論健康數據應用，但因法系差異，最終共識傾向符合台灣人情文化的知情同意模式。他介紹了兩種主要治理模式：美國NIH的「All of US」個人授權資料庫，以及TriNetX公司的醫療病例共享資料庫模式。華碩團隊曾參酌「All of US」模式，在健保署支持下與健康存摺合作試行「Databank」，實現個人健康大數據的授權應用，並參考歐盟GDPR與PULSE計畫，與基隆市政府合作進行試點。

在第二種模式上，華碩團隊於2018年與瑞士公司Clinerion合作，在台灣推動跨國臨床試驗醫療服務網路，透過標準化資料格式整合去識別化數據，秀傳醫療體系率先加入。TriNetX於223年併購Clinerion，整合了歐美系統，形成一個全球性的商業平台，讓藥廠能合法、合規地利用醫院數據進行查詢，醫院則可獲得商業回饋並參與優良臨床實驗。儘管此模式符合多項國際法規，且資料不離院，但吳漢章坦言，台灣醫院普遍存在適法性疑慮，且缺乏監管單位同意證明，導致推動不易。

吳漢章最後建議，台灣應建立一個具公信力的「生醫數據治理委員會」，透過良好的程序對話機制，為生醫數據資料庫治理提供結論，加速相關應用落地。","Following the 2025 ""Biotechnology Industry Strategy Conference (BTC)"" meeting, the Executive Yuan announced plans to establish a ""Health Data Service Company."" Prior to this, in February, ASUS Computer Group quietly partnered with the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) to form ""Taiwan Biomedical Big Data Technology Co., Ltd."" (TaiShengKe) with an initial capital of NT$100 million under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, becoming Taiwan's first health data application company. Dr. Wu Han-Chang, General Manager of ASUS Cloud and TaiZhi Cloud, serves as TaiShengKe's General Manager, with former NHRI President Academician Liang Kung-Yee as Chairman.

Dr. Wu Han-Chang shared his insights on health data governance, noting that the Taiwanese government had discussed health data applications as early as 2018. However, due to fundamental differences in legal systems compared to Europe and the US, the consensus leaned towards an informed consent approach more aligned with Taiwanese culture. He introduced two main data governance models: the US NIH's ""All of Us"" personal authorization database and TriNetX's medical record sharing database. The ASUS team, referencing the ""All of Us"" model, collaborated with the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) to pilot a ""Databank"" for personal health big data authorization. They also referenced EU GDPR and the ""EU PULSE Project"" under ""Horizon 2020"" for a pilot program with the Keelung City Government.

For the second model, the ASUS team partnered with Swiss company Clinerion in 2018 to promote a cross-national clinical trial medical service network in Taiwan, integrating de-identified data using standardized FHIR format. Changhua Christian Hospital Healthcare System was among the first to join. In 2023, TriNetX acquired Clinerion, integrating European and American systems into a unified global commercial platform. This model allows pharmaceutical companies to legally and compliantly query hospital data, while hospitals receive commercial benefits and participate in better clinical trials. Despite its compliance with various international regulations and the principle of data not leaving hospitals, Dr. Wu admitted that Taiwanese hospitals generally have legal concerns and lack regulatory approval, making implementation challenging.

Dr. Wu concluded by suggesting that Taiwan should establish a credible ""Biomedical Data Governance Committee"" to provide authoritative conclusions on biomedical data governance issues through a robust dialogue mechanism, thereby accelerating the implementation of related applications.",2025-09-03 03:24:42

梯瓦此前已於2024年6月推出Victoza（liraglutide）的學名藥版本，該藥主要用於第二型糖尿病，但醫師常以標籤外方式用於減重。儘管梯瓦未公布Victoza學名藥的具體銷售額，但其美國學名藥收入下降6%，部分歸因於Victoza學名藥銷售額的下滑及市場競爭加劇。

近年來，由於諾和諾德的semaglutide和禮來（Eli Lilly）的tirzepatide等新一代GLP-1藥物問世，原廠藥Victoza和Saxenda的銷售額顯著下滑。Victoza的銷售額從2018年的37億美元高峰跌至去年的8.62億美元；Saxenda則從2022年的16億美元降至今年上半年的3億美元。市場正密切關注liraglutide這類前一代GLP-1藥物是否會逐步被淘汰。","On August 28th, US time, Israeli generic drug giant Teva announced that its first ""weight-loss pen"" generic drug, a generic version of Novo Nordisk's Saxenda (liraglutide) injection pen, has received approval for market launch in the United States. This marks the first GLP-1 generic drug approved for weight management in the US. The generic drug is indicated for adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related medical conditions, and for obese adolescents aged 12-17 weighing over 60 kg, to aid in weight loss and maintenance. Teva has not yet disclosed the pricing for this generic version of Saxenda.

Teva had previously launched a generic version of Victoza (liraglutide) in June 2024, which is primarily indicated for type 2 diabetes but is often prescribed off-label for weight loss. While Teva did not disclose specific sales figures for its Victoza generic, its US generic revenue saw a 6% decline, partly attributed to decreased Victoza generic sales and intensified market competition.

In recent years, the sales of original drugs like Victoza and Saxenda have significantly dropped due to the emergence of next-generation GLP-1 drugs such as Novo Nordisk's semaglutide and Eli Lilly's tirzepatide. Victoza's sales peaked at approximately $3.7 billion in 2018 but fell to $862 million last year, while Saxenda's sales decreased from $1.6 billion in 2022 to just $300 million in the first half of this year. The market is closely watching whether older GLP-1 drugs like liraglutide will gradually be phased out.",2025-09-03 03:27:01

值得注意的是，這是諾華連續第二個月投資血腦屏障(BBB)穿透技術。今年7月，諾華才以1.75億美元前期金，取得Sironax獨家Brain Delivery Module技術的選擇權。對BioArctic而言，諾華是繼衛采(Eisai)和必治妥施貴寶(BMS)之後，第三家與其合作突破血腦屏障的大型製藥公司。BioArctic與衛采的合作曾催生出首款阿茲海默症抗體療法Leqembi (lecanemab)。此外，BioArctic也曾獲得BMS支付1億美元前期金及12.5億美元里程碑金，授權其平台開發針對β類澱粉蛋白的抗體藥物。

近年來，多家大型製藥公司紛紛加碼投資血腦屏障穿透技術，以期開發出更有效治療神經退化性疾病的藥物。例如，葛蘭素史克(GSK)與ABL Bio合作，投入近28億美元開發相關療法；禮來(Eli Lilly)也與Sangamo Therapeutics合作，投資高達14億美元，運用其親神經腺相關病毒(AAC)衣殼STAC-BBB平台開發療法。","On August 27th (US time), Novartis announced an investment totaling up to $800 million to collaborate with Swedish biotech company BioArctic. The partnership aims to develop antibody drugs for neurodegenerative diseases using BioArctic's proprietary BrainTransporter technology platform. Under the agreement, Novartis will pay an upfront fee of $30 million, with potential milestone payments reaching $772 million upon successful product launch, in addition to 5-6% sales royalties. BioArctic will combine its BrainTransporter technology with a therapeutic antibody from Novartis to co-develop new drug candidates, with Novartis subsequently taking responsibility for global development and commercialization.

This marks Novartis's second consecutive monthly investment in blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration technology, following a $175 million upfront payment in July for an exclusive option to Sironax's Brain Delivery Module technology. For BioArctic, Novartis is the third major pharmaceutical company to partner with them on BBB-penetrating technologies, after Eisai and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). BioArctic's collaboration with Eisai previously led to the development of Leqembi (lecanemab), the first antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease. BioArctic also secured a deal with BMS, including a $100 million upfront payment and $1.25 billion in milestones, for the rights to develop and commercialize BBB-penetrating antibodies targeting specific forms of β-amyloid.

In recent years, several major pharmaceutical companies have significantly increased their investments in BBB penetration technologies to develop more effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Examples include GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) investing nearly $2.8 billion in a partnership with ABL Bio for neurodegenerative disease therapies, and Eli Lilly collaborating with Sangamo Therapeutics with an investment of up to $1.4 billion to utilize Sangamo's neurotropic adeno-associated virus (AAC) capsid STAC-BBB platform for therapy development.",2025-09-03 03:29:32

This technology was validated in an independent study led by Taipei Veterans General Hospital and published in ""Molecular Diagnosis & Therapy."" The research demonstrated that applying Devin™ as a pre-processing step for metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) significantly enhances pathogen detection efficiency. Blood samples processed with Devin™ showed an average increase of over 10 times in microbial reads from extracted genomic DNA (gDNA), achieving a 100% pathogen detection rate in all blood culture-positive samples. The study highlighted that the Devin™ filter removes over 99% of leukocytes while preserving bacterial and and viral signals, with a microbial composition consistency correlation coefficient of 0.90 before and after processing. Compared to other host depletion methods, Devin™ performed better in operational efficiency, microbial signal retention, and procedural simplicity. Dr. Chen Yen-Chia, Assistant Professor and Attending Physician at Taipei Veterans General Hospital's Emergency Department, stated that this study confirms Devin™'s ability to improve pathogen detection efficiency when combined with gDNA as an analysis source, without altering microbial composition. This breakthrough is expected to overcome the long-standing issue of human DNA background interference in mNGS, holding significant implications for early and precise diagnosis of conditions like sepsis.",2025-09-03 03:27:48

研究團隊透過神經元細胞核RNA定序與質譜分析，比對3個月大與18個月大老年小鼠的海馬迴神經元，發現僅FTL1蛋白在年輕與老年小鼠間存在顯著差異，且老年小鼠海馬迴中FTL1含量增加與認知能力下降呈正相關。進一步研究顯示，FTL1升高會導致鐵的氧化狀態變化，加速類似老化的海馬突觸與認知退化特徵。透過抑制老年小鼠海馬迴神經元中的FTL1表現，研究人員觀察到突觸相關分子變化及認知障礙均獲得改善，神經元連結增加，老年小鼠在記憶測驗中表現更佳，行為也趨近年輕小鼠。這項研究證實神經元內的FTL1是驅動認知功能回春的關鍵分子，為未來開發阻斷FTL1在大腦作用的療法，以逆轉老年認知障礙與記憶衰退，開啟了新的希望。","A groundbreaking study by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) research team, published on August 19th (US time), identified light chain ferritin 1 (FTL1) as a key factor in brain aging. The research revealed that high expression of FTL1 in hippocampal neurons leads to memory loss, weakened brain connections, and sluggish cellular activity. Crucially, reducing FTL1 levels in aged mice was found to reverse age-related memory decline, achieving cognitive rejuvenation. These findings have been published in 《Nature Aging》.

Through neuronal nuclear RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry, the team compared hippocampal neurons from 3-month-old and 18-month-old mice, discovering that only FTL1 protein showed significant differences between young and old mice. An increase in FTL1 content in the hippocampus of aged mice was positively correlated with cognitive decline. Further investigation showed that elevated FTL1 leads to changes in iron oxidation states, accelerating aging-like hippocampal synaptic and cognitive degeneration. By inhibiting FTL1 expression in the hippocampal neurons of aged mice, researchers observed improvements in synapse-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments, increased neuronal connections, and better performance in memory tests, with behaviors resembling those of younger mice. This study confirms that neuronal FTL1 is a pivotal molecule driving cognitive rejuvenation, offering new hope for future therapies aimed at blocking FTL1's action in the brain to reverse age-related cognitive impairment and memory decline.",2025-09-03 03:27:36

Interius will be integrated into Gilead's subsidiary, Kite Pharma. While Kite Pharma already has two approved CAR-T cell therapies, Yescarta and Tecartus, these are traditional ex vivo treatments requiring cell collection, external genetic modification, and reinfusion. Interius's technology allows for in vivo gene editing for CAR-T cells, potentially offering a more convenient alternative. Gilead, which acquired Kite for $12 billion nearly a decade ago to become a CAR-T leader, has faced setbacks recently due to declining demand and increased competition. Consequently, Gilead has been actively expanding its CAR-T portfolio through acquisitions and collaborations, such as partnerships with Arcellx and Epic Bio. Interius's approach involves using modified viruses to deliver cancer receptor-targeting genes to specific immune cells. Its experimental drug, INT2104, is one of the first in vivo cell therapies to enter human clinical trials, currently in Phase 1 for blood cancer, with early research also underway for autoimmune diseases. Interius was spun out from the University of Pennsylvania in 2021 and completed a $76 million Series A funding round the same year. In vivo cell therapies are attracting significant interest from large pharmaceutical companies due to their potential to shorten treatment cycles, expand accessibility, and improve patient outcomes. Other recent examples include AstraZeneca's $425 million upfront acquisition of EsoBiotech in March and AbbVie's $2.1 billion purchase of Capstan Therapeutics in June.",2025-09-03 03:39:25

This research not only elucidates the neurobiological basis of obesity but also provides crucial directions for future weight loss drug development. The article highlights that obesity involves both brain-driven overeating and peripheral tissue energy preservation, emphasizing the necessity of understanding the intricate communication between the brain, gut, adipose tissue, and liver for effective treatments. The paper meticulously dissects specific CNS circuits, including the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) with its AgRP and POMC neurons, the brainstem's dorsal vagal complex (DVC) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) CALCR neurons (noting regional specificity of GLP-1 receptors), and the mesocorticolimbic system (VTA, LH) involved in motivation and reward, which partly explains the appeal of ultra-processed foods. Regarding weight loss therapies, the article reviews various pharmacological approaches: early monoamine-based drugs (achieving 8-10% weight loss but with significant side effects), GLP-1 receptor agonists like liraglutide (demonstrating 5.4% weight loss over 56 weeks in non-diabetic obese patients), dual glucagon agonists (combining GIPR and GLP-1R to mitigate nausea), and amylin receptor agonists. Notably, the dual GLP-1R/amylin receptor agonist, amycretin, is mentioned for achieving up to 24% weight loss in phase I/II clinical trials. The paper concludes by identifying key unanswered questions, such as which neuronal populations maintain 'discomfort-free' satiety and how diet and stress reshape synaptic plasticity in energy balance circuits, which are vital for optimizing personalized weight loss treatments and reducing discontinuation rates.",2025-09-03 03:39:01

Their findings, published in Nature, indicate that neuropods in the colon can detect flagellin released by microbes, immediately transmitting a ""satiety"" signal to the brain via the vagus nerve, thereby helping to regulate appetite and mood. Previous research had established gut sense as a neuro-based sensory modality beyond the traditional five senses, capable of detecting nutrient concentrations, intestinal wall tension, and microbial stimuli. Gut microbiota were also known to influence eating behavior through neuromodulators, immune signals, or the vagus nerve. However, a direct neural circuit allowing the host to sense microbial messages and regulate appetite remained unclear. The Duke team's experiments with mice demonstrated that after fasting, injecting a small amount of flagellin into the colon was detected by Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) on neuropods, which then transmitted satiety signals to the brain via the vagus nerve, leading to a significant decrease in the mice's appetite. Furthermore, mice lacking the TLR5 receptor continued to eat and developed symptoms of obesity, metabolic inflammation, and spontaneous colitis, confirming that the flagellin-induced appetite regulation is independent of immune responses and metabolic changes. This study identifies a previously unknown gut-brain sensory modality, offering new insights into the causes of conditions like obesity and mental illness, with future research planned to explore how specific diets alter the gut's microbial environment.",2025-09-03 03:42:40

They utilized high-throughput bioprinting technology to create personalized tumor organoids from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients' tumor cells for in vitro drug testing, with results published in 《Biofabrication》. This innovation is expected to accelerate the development of personalized therapies, addressing the limitations of traditional organoid techniques, which often rely on Matrigel, require manual operation, exhibit high variability, functional immaturity, and low throughput, hindering scalability. The team's extrusion-based high-throughput bioprinter rapidly and stably generates heterogeneous RCC organoids of uniform size, preserving the original tumor's pathological morphology, gene mutations, and expression profiles. Furthermore, by reassembling RCC polymers with matrix components into multicellular assembloids, they created structures with in vivo-like vascular morphology and spatial tumor microenvironment heterogeneity, closely mimicking the human body. This highly simulated in vivo model allows researchers to more reliably study tumor development and test various therapies, while significantly reducing manual labor, thereby enhancing the speed and scalability of drug testing. This technology, by establishing patient-specific tumor organoids, is poised to enable the development of precision therapies, improve survival rates, reduce unnecessary side effects, and expedite the drug discovery-to-clinical application process.

Ravetch醫師研究團隊成功設計出一款改良的CD40促效型抗體2141-V11。該抗體在臨床一期試驗中展現了良好的安全性，並能有效促進具免疫優勢的腫瘤微環境。更重要的是，透過局部注射，它能引發全身性且持久的抗腫瘤免疫反應。研究結果已發表於《Cancer Cell》。過去的CD40促效劑因全身毒性強且療效不佳而受限，但Ravetch團隊改良的2141-V11能更緊密結合CD40並透過Fc受體交聯，誘導出強10倍的免疫反應，同時將給藥途徑改為腫瘤內注射，大幅降低毒性。在針對12位轉移性癌症患者（包括黑色素瘤、腎細胞癌、乳癌等）的臨床一期試驗中，儘管僅有25%~30%的患者對免疫療法有反應，但無患者出現嚴重副作用或劑量限制毒性。其中6位患者腫瘤縮小，2位患者達到完全緩解，證明了局部注射可達全身性反應。例如，一名黑色素瘤患者僅在大腿一處腫瘤內注射藥物，全身腫瘤便完全消失；另一名乳癌患者僅注射皮膚腫瘤，全身腫瘤也同樣消失。腫瘤組織切片顯示，藥物不僅使腫瘤被免疫細胞取代，還形成與患者完全緩解相關的三級淋巴樣結構（TLS），甚至在未注射的腫瘤中也能觀察到TLS。目前，研究團隊正與紀念斯隆-凱特琳癌症中心及杜克大學合作，針對膀胱癌、攝護腺癌、膠質母細胞瘤等難治癌症，進行約200位患者的臨床一期、二期試驗，期望未來能釐清反應差異並尋找生物標誌，推動該療法發展為高效且廣泛適用的抗癌療法。,"A research team led by Dr. Jeffrey V. Ravetch at Rockefeller University has successfully designed a modified CD40 agonistic antibody, 2141-V11. Clinical Phase I trials demonstrated excellent safety and the ability to foster an immune-privileged tumor microenvironment. Crucially, local injection of 2141-V11 triggered a systemic and durable anti-tumor immune response. These findings were published in 《Cancer Cell》. Previous CD40 agonists were limited by strong systemic toxicity and poor clinical efficacy. However, Ravetch's team modified 2141-V11 to bind more tightly to CD40 and cross-link via Fc receptors, inducing a 10-fold stronger immune response. By switching the administration route from traditional intravenous injection to intratumoral injection, they significantly reduced toxicity. In the Phase I trial involving 12 patients with metastatic cancers (including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and breast cancer), no severe side effects or dose-limiting toxicities were observed, despite a 25-30% response rate to immunotherapy. Six patients experienced tumor shrinkage, and two achieved complete remission, demonstrating that local injection can achieve systemic effects. For instance, a melanoma patient with metastatic tumors on the leg saw all tumors disappear after only local injection into one thigh tumor. Similarly, a breast cancer patient with metastatic tumors in the skin, liver, and lungs achieved complete remission of all tumors after only injecting a skin tumor. Tumor biopsies revealed that the drug not only led to tumor replacement by immune cells but also the formation of Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS), which correlated with complete remission, even in un-injected tumors. The research team is now collaborating with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Duke University to conduct Phase I/II trials involving approximately 200 patients with difficult-to-treat cancers such as bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma. Future efforts will focus on understanding why some patients respond well while others do not, and identifying biomarkers to predict or transform responses, aiming to develop this therapy into a highly effective and broadly applicable anti-cancer treatment.",2025-09-03 03:40:26

These findings hold major clinical implications for precision medicine and optimizing liver cancer screening strategies. The first study, ERADICATE-B, led by Dr. Tseng Tai-Chung of NTUH, found that non-cirrhotic, inactive chronic hepatitis B patients with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) serum levels below 100 IU/mL had an annual liver cancer incidence rate of only 0.08%, significantly lower than the internationally recommended monitoring threshold of 0.2%. This suggests these patients are close to achieving a functional cure for Hepatitis B. The second study, REVEAL-HBV, led by Academician Chen Chien-Jen of Academia Sinica's Genomic Research Center, for the first time revealed that chronic hepatitis B patients in the immune tolerant phase with HBsAg levels above 10,000 IU/mL exhibited a delayed development of liver cancer. This discovery helps define truly low-risk immune tolerant populations, thereby avoiding overtreatment. Both papers were co-corresponding authored by Professor Kao Chia-Hung of NTUH and Associate Research Fellow Yang Huai-Yi of Academia Sinica's Genomic Research Center. The research outcomes contribute significantly to redefining ""partial HBV cure"" and the clinical management of the immune tolerant phase, providing crucial evidence for future revisions of international treatment guidelines.",2025-09-03 03:45:44

This approval is based on data from a Phase 3 clinical study initiated in 2021, which enrolled 1,200 adult patients with Stage 2 or 3 liver fibrosis and MASH. The study results, presented at the AASL annual meeting last November, showed that after 72 weeks, approximately 37% of Wegovy-treated patients experienced improved liver fibrosis without worsening steatohepatitis; 62.9% achieved steatohepatitis resolution without worsening liver fibrosis; and 32.8% simultaneously achieved both steatohepatitis resolution and improved liver fibrosis. Wegovy is now available in the U.S. for adult MASH patients with moderate to severe liver fibrosis, to be used in conjunction with appropriate diet and exercise. Novo Nordisk has also submitted marketing applications in Europe and Japan, with results from the second part of the clinical study expected in 2029. Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's head of U.S. operations, stated that MASH approval would help elevate Wegovy's position on pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) lists.

This delay is primarily due to the upcoming US-Russia summit taking precedence and the government's need to first finalize decisions on semiconductor tariffs. President Trump has been consistently pressuring the pharmaceutical industry, initially proposing a 200% import tariff on drugs, which he later escalated to 250%, while also suggesting a grace period for companies to adjust their supply chains. In July, the US already implemented a 15% tariff on pharmaceutical imports from the EU, a measure analysts estimate could impose an additional $19 billion in costs on the industry. Part of the ongoing delay in the drug tariff decision is also linked to the ""Section 232 investigation"" into drug and related product imports, launched by the US government in early April, which assesses potential national security threats. In response to these tariff threats, major pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, and Roche, have invested billions of dollars in the United States to bolster their domestic manufacturing capabilities. Furthermore, the persistent tariff uncertainty has led many companies to front-load shipments, resulting in the Port of Los Angeles recording its highest monthly container throughput in 117 years in July.",2025-09-03 03:49:35

The International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) updated its ""2021 Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation,"" specifically addressing the development and application of human stem cell-based embryo models (SCBEMs). The updated guidelines emphasize clear scientific rationale, defined endpoints, and appropriate oversight for all 3D SCBEMs, reiterating that SCBEMs are in vitro models not to be transplanted into living animal or human hosts, and prohibiting their in vitro culture to a potentially viable stage.

In the U.S., Apple Inc. announced the return of the Apple Watch's blood oxygen tracking feature after an 18-month ban, enabled by a software update. Users can now view measurement results via the Health app on their paired iPhone. This feature was previously halted due to a patent dispute with patient monitor developer Masimo and a federal import ban threat.

Furthermore, at the upcoming U.S.-Russia summit, Trump is expected to prioritize discussions on ending the war in Ukraine. The highly anticipated drug tariffs are likely to be postponed until a decision is made on semiconductor tariffs, with market predictions suggesting no resolution this month.

79495,https://news.gbimonthly.com/tw/article/show.php?num=79495,《Nature》首證「大腦鋰失衡」是失智前兆！？,2025-08-14,Harvard Medical School,Harvard Medical School,哈佛醫學院是一所世界頂尖的醫學教育與研究機構，致力於醫學科學的教學、研究與創新，以推動人類健康福祉。,哈佛醫學院研究團隊於美國時間8月6日發表於《Nature》的研究指出，大腦中的「鋰失衡」可能是失智症的早期前兆。研究人員利用先進質譜技術，測量健康人士、輕度認知障礙(MCI)患者及晚期阿茲海默症(AD)患者腦與血液中27種金屬微量元素，首次發現鋰在記憶喪失最早期便出現變化，且MCI與AD患者大腦內源性鋰出現失衡。研究進一步發現，澱粉樣蛋白在早期失智階段沉積時會與鋰結合，降低鋰在大腦中的作用。在小鼠模型中限制鋰攝取，會顯著增加β-類澱粉蛋白沉積與磷酸化tau蛋白累積，並導致神經退化。研究團隊也發現，以「鋰乳清酸鹽」的形式補充鋰，即使在病程晚期的小鼠中也能逆轉疾病損害並恢復記憶功能，且早期維持穩定的鋰濃度可預防小鼠AD發作。儘管目前已有少數臨床試驗顯示補充鋰對延緩AD有療效，但傳統鋰鹽在高劑量下對老年人有毒性。研究人員強調，目前尚無證據顯示鋰能安全有效地保護人類免於神經退化，不建議自行服用鋰製劑。若未來研究持續驗證，鋰檢測有望成為阿茲海默症的早期篩檢工具，而鋰乳清酸鹽或類似化合物亦有望進入臨床試驗，為AD治療帶來突破。,"A study by a Harvard Medical School research team, published in Nature on August 6th (US time), suggests that an imbalance of lithium in the brain could be an early precursor to dementia. Using advanced mass spectrometry, researchers measured 27 trace metal elements in the brains and blood of healthy individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. They discovered for the first time that lithium levels change at the very earliest stages of memory loss, with an imbalance of endogenous lithium observed in the brains of MCI and AD patients. The study further revealed that amyloid protein, when deposited in early dementia stages, binds with lithium, reducing its efficacy in the brain. Restricting lithium intake in mouse models significantly increased β-amyloid deposition and phosphorylated tau protein accumulation, leading to neurodegeneration. The team also found that supplementing lithium in the form of ""lithium orotate"" could reverse disease damage and restore memory function, even in late-stage mice, and that maintaining stable lithium levels early on prevented AD onset in mice. While some clinical trials have shown lithium supplementation to be effective in delaying AD, traditional lithium salts can be toxic to the elderly at high doses. Researchers emphasize that there is currently no evidence that lithium can safely and effectively protect humans from neurodegeneration, and self-medication with lithium preparations is not recommended. If future research continues to validate these effects, lithium detection could become an early screening tool for Alzheimer's, and lithium orotate or similar compounds may advance to clinical trials, offering a breakthrough in AD treatment.",2025-09-03 03:51:16
79496,https://news.gbimonthly.com/tw/article/show.php?num=79496,《Science》Denali二代阿茲海默症療法 可穿透血腦障壁、改善腦出血,2025-08-14,"Denali Therapeutics, Biogen (百健), Eisai (衛采), Roche (羅氏), Eli Lilly (禮來), AbbVie (艾伯維), Johnson & Johnson (嬌生)",Denali Therapeutics,Denali Therapeutics 是一家位於舊金山灣區的生技公司，致力於開發治療阿茲海默症、帕金森氏症及肌萎縮性脊髓側索硬化症等神經退化性疾病的創新藥物。,"美國時間8月7日，Denali Therapeutics 宣布開發出一款創新的阿茲海默症抗體藥物，其獨特之處在於能有效穿透血腦障壁，並清除整個大腦的類澱粉斑塊，同時顯著避免了第一代Aβ藥物常見的嚴重副作用，如類澱粉相關影像異常（ARIA），包括腦水腫和腦部出血。這項突破性研究成果已發表於《Science》期刊。
目前市場上，百健（Biogen）和衛采（Eisai）合作開發的aducanumab雖於2021年獲准，成為首個清除類澱粉斑塊的阿茲海默症藥物，但其引發的ARIA腦出血問題，使其安全性備受質疑。Denali的新型抗體透過結合血腦屏障外部的轉鐵蛋白受體，成功穿越屏障並廣泛分布於大腦，小鼠實驗證實其療效良好且無ARIA發生。此外，Denali還改造了抗體Fc區段以降低免疫反應。該療法目前正進行臨床前研究，預計明年申請新藥臨床試驗（IND）。
文章也提及，第一代Aβ藥物如已停售的aducanumab、禮來（Eli Lilly）的欣智樂（Kisunla）以及百健與衛采的樂意保（Leqembi），皆因ARIA的安全性爭議而面臨挑戰。ARIA的成因可能與抗體在血管內聚集而非進入大腦實質清除斑塊有關，進而引發免疫反應導致血管損傷和出血。
在第二代Aβ藥物方面，羅氏（Roche）的候選藥物trontinemab（結合轉鐵蛋白受體）即將進入臨床三期試驗；艾伯維（AbbVie）去年也收購了Aliada Therapeutics，取得一款由嬌生（Johnson & Johnson）技術授權、同樣能穿越血腦障壁的藥物。Denali的創新療法有望為阿茲海默症治療帶來更安全有效的選擇。","On August 7th, US time, Denali Therapeutics announced the development of an innovative antibody drug for Alzheimer's disease. This new therapy is distinguished by its ability to effectively penetrate the blood-brain barrier and clear amyloid plaques throughout the brain, while significantly avoiding severe side effects like amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), including brain edema and hemorrhage, which are common with first-generation Aβ drugs. This groundbreaking research has been published in *Science*.
Currently, existing treatments include aducanumab, co-developed by Biogen and Eisai, which was approved in 2021 as the first Alzheimer's drug to clear amyloid plaques. However, its association with severe ARIA-related brain hemorrhages has raised significant safety concerns. Denali's novel antibody successfully crosses the blood-brain barrier by binding to transferrin receptors on its exterior, allowing for widespread distribution and plaque clearance in the brain. Mouse studies have demonstrated good efficacy without ARIA occurrence. Furthermore, Denali has modified the antibody's Fc region to reduce potential immune responses. The therapy is currently in preclinical research, with an Investigational New Drug (IND) application expected next year.
The article also notes that first-generation Aβ drugs, such as the discontinued aducanumab, Eli Lilly's Kisunla, and Biogen/Eisai's Leqembi, have all faced challenges due to ARIA safety controversies. ARIA is believed to result from antibodies accumulating around amyloid in blood vessels rather than entering the brain parenchyma to clear plaques, triggering immune responses that damage vessels and cause bleeding.
Regarding second-generation Aβ drugs, Roche's candidate trontinemab, which also binds to transferrin receptors, is nearing Phase III clinical trials. Additionally, AbbVie last year acquired Aliada Therapeutics, obtaining a drug originally licensed from Johnson & Johnson that can also cross the blood-brain barrier. Denali's innovative therapy holds promise for offering a safer and more effective treatment option for Alzheimer's disease.",2025-09-03 03:51:06

Under the agreement, Kumquat will be responsible for the Phase 1a clinical trial of the partnered drug, with Bayer taking the lead on subsequent research, development, and commercialization. Kumquat will also have an exclusive option to negotiate profit and loss sharing with Bayer in the U.S. market. KRAS is a common oncogenic mutation, and the KRAS G12D mutation, affecting approximately 38% of pancreatic cancer patients, has long been considered an ""undruggable"" target. Kumquat received FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) approval last month. This partnership aims to strengthen Bayer's precision oncology portfolio, integrating the KRAS G12D inhibitor into its oncology pipeline, which currently includes the prostate cancer drug darolutamide and the NSCLC drug sevabertinib. The article also notes that following the successful development of KRAS G12C drugs by Amgen and Mirati Therapeutics, investment and focus on other KRAS mutation types have increased. Revolution Medicines' KRAS G12D drug, zoldonrasib, is currently a global leader for pancreatic cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, progressing to pivotal trials. Bristol Myers Squibb, after acquiring Mirati, had a KRAS G12D inhibitor but withdrew from the competition earlier this year due to formulation challenges. Furthermore, Astellas, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, and Roche also have KRAS G12D inhibitors, degraders, or TCR-engineered T cells in clinical trials. Kumquat previously signed a $1.2 billion immuno-oncology collaboration with Takeda and has established partnerships with Eli Lilly, demonstrating its active engagement in KRAS signaling pathway research.",2025-09-03 03:53:09

日商大和創投董事總經理兒玉俊太郎指出，儘管全球生技產業都在吸引外資，但美國資本市場相對安靜，日本IPO市場則較為挑剔。他強調台灣股市表現優於其他國家，因此大和創投計畫在台灣進行更多投資，並協助有潛力的公司在台上市。兒玉俊太郎也提到日本政府大力支持生技新創，並希望結合台灣半導體、ICT產業與強大資本市場的優勢，在AI領域尋找合作機會。

來自波士頓Kendall Capital Partners創投基金的合夥人David Zhu分享，Kendall創投已推出兩檔專注於日本和台灣早期生物技術公司的風險投資基金。他強調，無論美國政策如何變化，都不會影響投資者在全球尋求生命科學領域的合作，因為疾病治療的原則是普世的。David Zhu指出，儘管美國部分研發預算被削減，但FDA批准程序未變，臨床試驗中的公司仍可按計畫進行。然而，全球資本市場對生技投資趨於謹慎，成功獲得超過2000萬美元種子輪的公司減少，投資者更關注實際臨床實驗數據。他強調美國、台灣和中國之間的私人產業合作將持續，並看重與研究機構的早期育成合作，許多美國投資者正尋求將亞洲技術授權至美國或其他地區成立公司並規劃IPO，台灣優異的研究能力使其成為重要的合作夥伴。","Diamond Biofund Inc. (6901), in collaboration with the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) and Taipei Exchange (TPEx), hosted the '2025 Asia-Pacific Biotech Investment Forum' today. Diamond Biofund Chairman Yang Pan-chyr stated that Taiwan's advanced biotechnology development holds immense potential. He advocated for encouraging young people to commercialize innovative lab technologies to foster a thriving biotech industry, attract more overseas capital, and position Taiwan's IPO market as a top choice for international investors.

Shuntaro Kodama, Managing Director of Daiwa Corporate Investment, noted that while many countries are vying for foreign biotech investment, the US capital market is relatively quiet, and Japan's IPO market is selective. He highlighted Taiwan's superior stock market performance, leading Daiwa Ventures to plan increased investments in Taiwan and assist promising companies in listing there. Kodama also mentioned strong Japanese government support for biotech startups and expressed interest in combining Taiwan's strengths in semiconductors, ICT, and a robust capital market to explore AI opportunities.

David Zhu, Partner at Boston-based Kendall Capital Partners, shared that Kendall Ventures has launched two venture capital funds focused on early-stage biotech companies in Japan and Taiwan. He emphasized that US policy changes would not deter global collaboration in life sciences, as disease treatments are universal. Zhu noted that despite cuts to some US R&D budgets, FDA approval processes remain unchanged, allowing companies in clinical trials to proceed as planned. However, the global capital market has become more cautious towards biotech investments, with fewer companies successfully raising over $20 million in seed rounds unless backed by top scientists. Investors are now prioritizing actual clinical trial data over preclinical or animal study results. He stressed the ongoing private sector cooperation between the US, Taiwan, and China, highlighting the importance of early-stage collaboration with research institutions. Many US investors are seeking to license technologies from Asia to establish companies in the US or elsewhere for IPOs, making Taiwan's excellent research capabilities a crucial partnership.",2025-09-03 05:25:22

此外，川普政府也正與製藥公司商談，希望提高歐洲及其他地區的藥價，以降低美國的藥品成本。美方官員向藥廠表示，若採「最惠國價格」政策（即美國藥價與其他富裕國家一致），美方將支持其國際談判。禮來執行長David Ricks對此表示樂觀，但指出歐洲政府不會主動提高藥價，需貿易工具重新平衡。健康經濟學家Anna Kaltenboeck則認為，美國藥價可調降，不需提高他國藥價。歐盟委員會發言人表示，若美國加徵關稅，雙方協議上限為15%。一名歐洲藥廠高層透露，儘管川普政府施壓，但與業界會談的首要任務仍是提高歐洲藥價。","On August 7th, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a new ""PreCheck"" program aimed at accelerating the construction and review processes for domestic pharmaceutical factories. This initiative aligns with President Trump's executive order from May, which seeks to strengthen the U.S. domestic drug supply chain. The PreCheck program will streamline review procedures for domestic manufacturing facilities, removing unnecessary regulatory requirements, and will be implemented in two phases to assist new facilities with enhanced communication and pre-market meetings. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary stated that this is part of broader efforts to reduce U.S. reliance on overseas drug manufacturing. Major pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, and Johnson & Johnson, have already pledged billions of dollars to expand their U.S. operations. The Trump administration has also threatened to impose tariffs, potentially up to 250%, on drug imports to further promote domestic production.
Furthermore, the Trump administration is negotiating with pharmaceutical companies to raise drug prices in Europe and other regions to lower costs in the U.S. U.S. officials have indicated support for international negotiations if companies adopt a ""most-favored-nation price"" policy, aligning U.S. drug prices with lower prices in other wealthy nations. Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks expressed optimism but noted that European governments would not voluntarily raise prices, necessitating trade tools for rebalancing. Health economist Anna Kaltenboeck suggested that U.S. drug prices could be lowered without increasing prices elsewhere. The European Commission stated that a 15% tariff cap has been agreed upon if the U.S. imposes additional tariffs. A European pharmaceutical executive revealed that despite U.S. pressure on tariffs and reshoring manufacturing, raising European drug prices remains a primary focus in industry discussions.",2025-09-03 05:26:05

This marks the first FDA-approved drug specifically for this aggressive type of brain cancer and is a significant outcome of Jazz Pharmaceuticals' $935 million acquisition of the drug from Chimerix in March this year. Modeyso is a first-in-class small molecule drug with a dual mechanism of action, selectively binding to dopamine receptor D2 and activating mitochondrial protease ClpP, thereby inducing tumor cell apoptosis. The approval was based on an open-label trial showing an overall response rate (ORR) of 22% and a median duration of response of 10.3 months. H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma is a highly aggressive and rare pediatric and adult brain tumor for which no FDA-approved systemic treatment options previously existed. Chimerix had estimated that approximately 2,000 patients in the U.S. could be eligible for Modeyso treatment, touting its potential as an 'ultra-orphan drug' and anticipating rapid market revenue upon approval, which was a key incentive for Jazz Pharmaceuticals' acquisition.",2025-09-03 05:29:02

Staar Surgical以其Evo與Visian植入式隱形眼鏡（ICL）聞名，這些產品專為中度至高度近視患者設計，可作為眼鏡、傳統隱形眼鏡及LASIK雷射手術的替代選擇。儘管Staar的產品線已擴及遠視矯正，但尚未在美國獲准上市。

此次收購正值Staar面臨中國市場需求顯著下滑的困境。今年第一季，Staar因中國市場通路庫存計畫性減少，導致淨銷售額年減45%至4,260萬美元。為應對挑戰，Staar已裁員約115人，並重整高層管理團隊，同時調整製造基地以規避中國高額關稅，包括提前將庫存運往中國、提升瑞士產能並減緩美國工廠生產速度。

愛爾康執行長David Endicott表示，此交易將使愛爾康的業務從隱形眼鏡拓展至眼科外科手術領域。Staar執行長Stephen Farrell也指出，儘管過去兩年中國市場波動帶來阻力，但被愛爾康併購將加速植入式隱形眼鏡的普及，將其創新技術推廣給更多醫師與患者。","On August 6th, US time, Alcon, a global leader in eye care, announced its acquisition of the struggling Staar Surgical for $1.5 billion in cash, at $28 per share. This price represents approximately a 59% premium over Staar's average share price for the past three months, with the transaction expected to close within 6 to 12 months. Alcon aims to expand its ophthalmic implantable lens product line and enter the myopia correction market through this acquisition, offering patients a more comprehensive range of myopia treatment options.

Staar Surgical is known for its Evo and Visian Implantable Contact Lenses (ICL), designed for patients with moderate to high myopia, with or without astigmatism. These ICLs are implanted via minimally invasive surgery between the iris and the eye's natural lens, serving as an alternative to glasses, traditional contact lenses, and LASIK surgery. Staar's product line also includes hyperopia correction, though it is not yet approved in the US.

The acquisition comes as Staar faces significant challenges, particularly a decline in demand from the Chinese market. In the first quarter of this year, Staar's net sales plummeted by 45% year-over-year to $42.6 million, primarily due to a planned reduction in channel inventory in China. In response, Staar has laid off approximately 115 employees, restructured its senior management team, and adjusted its manufacturing strategy to mitigate high Chinese tariffs by pre-shipping inventory to China, increasing Swiss production capacity, and slowing down US factory output.

Alcon CEO David Endicott stated that this deal allows Alcon to expand from contact lenses into ophthalmic surgery. Staar CEO Stephen Farrell also commented that despite the significant headwinds from China's market volatility over the past two years, the acquisition by Alcon will accelerate the adoption of implantable contact lenses, bringing their innovative technology to more doctors and patients.",2025-09-03 05:30:42

STLI Director Wang Jin-li highlighted the need for robust legal frameworks to support the biomedical industry amidst an aging population and rapid technological advancements. Lin Guan-yu, Director of STLI's Cross-Domain Integration Center, emphasized that international regulations encourage collaboration between regulators and industry to accumulate research data, rather than avoiding new technologies. Legal researcher Chang Hui-chieh presented an analysis of accelerated drug approval mechanisms in the US, EU, and Australia, including priority review, accelerated approval, and special designations like orphan drug status and breakthrough therapy. The US FDA's Priority Review can shorten review times by 40%, and orphan drugs receive 7 years of market exclusivity and transferable rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers. The EU offers 10 years of market protection for orphan drugs and incentives for new drugs to launch there first. Australia can reference review results from seven comparable overseas regulators and participates in multi-country joint reviews. Taiwan currently has priority review (reducing review time from 360 to 240 days), accelerated approval, and a simplified review mechanism that references approvals from at least two countries (US, EU, Japan). Rare disease and pediatric/minor severe disease drugs are managed under a 'dual-law' system, with rare disease drugs receiving 10 years of market protection. However, the report identified three major challenges for Taiwan: 1) The threshold for simplified review is too high, requiring two overseas approvals compared to Australia's one. 2) Incentives for rare diseases and pediatric/minor severe diseases need differentiation, with suggestions for adding market protection for the latter due to strict rare disease definitions tied to NHI budgets. 3) Taiwan lacks a dedicated regenerative medicine designation, and it is recommended to expedite the implementation of related sub-laws and introduce incentives to accelerate product launch.",2025-09-03 05:35:36

資策會科法所跨域整合中心生醫衛政組組長黃毓瑩強調，法規不應被視為障礙，而應理解並善用其成為「武器」，並指出台灣生技廠商可能過於側重研發，而忽略策略佈局。資策會科法所期望透過研究將法規轉化為業界工具，並與其他法人單位合作，將業界意見納入未來白皮書。

寇怡衡主任進一步說明，ODD是全球新藥上市的關鍵門票，近年來美國FDA核准的新藥中，超過三分之二獲得特殊認定。截至2025年5月底，FDA已授予逾7,385項孤兒藥資格認定，其中1,323項已獲上市許可。儘管孤兒藥市場規模相對有限，但競爭者少且藥價高，發展潛力不容小覷，例如嬌生（J&J）的Darzalex和Vertex的Trikafta均為暢銷孤兒藥。Vertex更預測其孤兒藥將佔總銷售額的94%。許多藥廠如Keytruda，皆採先從罕見疾病適應症切入市場，上市後再擴展至更大市場的策略，並利用ODD的市場專屬權延長保護期。

在RMAT方面，自2016年底FDA新增此認定後，申請案呈增長趨勢，2024年核准率已突破七成。案例包括全球首個TCR-T療法Tecelra和組織工程血管移植產品Symvess，以及吉立亞醫藥（Gilead Sciences）的CAR-T產品Yescarta，均顯示RMAT能加速療法上市。寇怡衡總結，ODD的最大優勢在於上市後的市場專屬權保護期，藥廠可選擇聚焦特定罕病或利用ODD加速上市後再擴展市場。此外，FDA也推出新的加速核准替代終點「微量殘存疾病（MRD）」及國家優先憑證（CNPV）試點計畫，旨在縮短新藥審查時間，但產品的臨床效益仍是最終價值所在。","This report highlights a conference titled ""Report Release Conference on Accelerated Market Launch Strategies for Innovative Drugs,"" held during BIO Asia-Taiwan. The event was a collaborative effort between the Science & Technology Law Institute (STLI) of the Institute for Information Industry (III) and the Development Center for Biotechnology (DCB), guided by the Department of Industrial Technology, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and executed by the Taiwan Bio Industry Organization. During the conference, Kou Yi-Heng, Director of Planning and Control at DCB, shared insights into how international pharmaceutical companies leverage Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) to accelerate market entry, gain first-mover advantage, and extend product lifecycles.

Huang Yu-Ying, Group Leader of the Biomedical and Health Policy Group at STLI, III, emphasized that regulations should not be viewed as obstacles but rather as ""weapons"" to be understood and utilized. She noted that Taiwanese biotech companies might overemphasize R&D while neglecting strategic planning to enhance product viability. STLI aims to transform regulations into effective tools for the industry and plans to collaborate with other organizations to gather industry feedback for future white papers.

Director Kou Yi-Heng further elaborated that ODD is a critical ""ticket"" for new drug launches, with over two-thirds of FDA-approved new drugs in recent years receiving special designations. As of May 2025, the FDA had granted over 7,385 ODDs, with 1,323 approved for marketing. Despite the relatively small patient population, orphan drugs offer less competition and higher prices, indicating significant market potential. Examples include Johnson & Johnson's (J&J) Darzalex and Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Trikafta, both top-selling orphan drugs. Vertex, for instance, projects orphan drugs to account for 94% of its total sales. Many pharmaceutical companies, such as the developer of Keytruda, strategically enter the market with rare disease indications and then expand to larger markets, utilizing ODD's market exclusivity to extend protection.

Regarding RMAT, Kou Yi-Heng observed a growing trend since its introduction in late 2016, with the approval rate exceeding 70% in 2024. Case studies like Tecelra (the first TCR-T therapy for solid tumors) and Symvess (the first tissue-engineered vascular graft), as well as Gilead Sciences' CAR-T product Yescarta, demonstrate how RMAT can accelerate therapy launches. Kou Yi-Heng concluded that ODD's primary advantage lies in post-market exclusivity. Companies can either focus on specific rare diseases or use ODD to accelerate development before expanding to broader markets.

This marks a significant milestone, offering patients a less invasive and more affordable alternative to highly invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling or expensive PET scans. The guidelines aim to support developers in creating accurate and accessible Alzheimer's blood tests, while emphasizing their supplementary role in diagnosis. Applicable blood tests primarily detect pathological biomarkers such as p-tau and Aβ proteins. Two thresholds are outlined: tests with over 90% sensitivity and 75% specificity can serve as triaging tools, while those exceeding 90% in both sensitivity and specificity may potentially replace PET or CSF examinations. The Association cautions that the accuracy of commercially available blood tests varies widely, urging responsible use by clinicians. In Taiwan, MagQu Co., Ltd. has developed an Immunomagnetic Reduction (IMR) test, obtaining EU CE IVD and Taiwan Class III medical device certifications, and is being used by Janssen in clinical trials. Nano-J Technology Co., Ltd.'s Fiber Optic Plasmon Resonance (FOPPR) chip technology has also been adopted by medical centers in Europe and the US.

The study found that certain tissues, such as blood vessels, age noticeably faster than others. Led by Liu Guanghui's team from the Beijing Institute of Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the research involved collecting 516 tissue samples from eight major organ systems of 76 Chinese individuals aged 14 to 68 who died from accidental brain injuries. The team successfully established tissue-specific protein aging clocks, mapping organ-level aging trajectories. Their analysis indicated that the overall protein change turning point occurs between 45 and 55 years old, with blood vessels being the earliest and most sensitive tissues to aging. Furthermore, researchers identified a protein produced by the aorta that, when injected into mice, accelerated their aging. They also defined a set of aging-related plasma protein characteristics and identified candidate senoproteins, including GAS6, which may promote vascular and systemic aging. This study, published in *Cell*, complements previous research limited to blood samples by observing aging changes directly from actual organ tissues, offering crucial insights for developing future intervention strategies to promote healthy aging.",2025-09-03 05:36:57

The findings were published in 《JAMA Neurology》. While Ambroxol is approved in Europe for respiratory conditions and known for its safety, it is not yet approved for any indication in Canada or the United States. The 12-month clinical trial, led by cognitive neurologist Stephen Pasternak, involved 55 PDD patients, divided into an Ambroxol group and a placebo group, with monitoring of memory, psychiatric symptoms, and the brain injury marker GFAP. Results showed that subjects in the Ambroxol group maintained stable mental conditions, whereas the placebo group experienced deterioration. Furthermore, the brain cell damage indicator GFAP increased in the placebo group but remained stable in the Ambroxol group, suggesting potential neuroprotective effects. Notably, participants carrying the high-risk GBA1 gene mutation also showed improved cognitive performance after taking Ambroxol. The study elucidated Ambroxol's mechanism of action: it promotes the activity of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), an enzyme produced by the GBA1 gene. In Parkinson's patients, GCase expression is often low, and its dysfunction leads to waste accumulation and damage in brain cells. The research team is now extending these findings to other Parkinson's-related diseases, exploring whether increasing GCase levels can protect the brain.",2025-09-03 05:36:37

過去普遍認為大腦細胞在出生後固定不變，儘管90年代後有研究標記到活躍分裂細胞，但近年來利用螢光抗體標記蛋白質的成人研究結果並不一致。此次研究中，研究團隊由Jonas Frisén領導，透過分析成年老鼠的年輕神經元基因活性特徵，並比對人類死後組織的單細胞RNA定序數據，開發出篩選方法，從近30萬個人類海馬迴細胞中辨識出潛在的神經前驅細胞。這些細胞可以在成年後分裂並產生神經元。

研究也指出，每個人腦中神經前驅細胞數量差異極大，顯示可能受環境或生理因素影響；年輕人通常較多，但有部分成年人完全未發現。然而，目前尚不清楚這些細胞是新產生或長期未成熟。匹茲堡大學的神經科學家Shawn Sorrells則建議，演算法辨識的可能為神經膠細胞前驅細胞或其他，需進一步驗證。這項研究為成人神經新生提供了新證據，未來將探討其速度與阿茲海默症等認知功能退化的關聯，以期找出潛在療法。","Researchers at Sweden's Karolinska Institutet have published a groundbreaking study in the journal *Science*, utilizing machine learning and single-cell transcriptomics to identify 354 cells with neural progenitor characteristics in the adult human hippocampus. This discovery may finally resolve a century-long debate about whether neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons) occurs in the adult brain.

Historically, it was believed that brain cells were fixed after birth, though some studies in the 1990s identified actively dividing cells. However, recent adult studies using fluorescent antibody labeling have yielded inconsistent results. In this new research, led by Jonas Frisén's team, scientists analyzed gene activity features of young neurons in adult mouse brains and compared them with single-cell RNA sequencing data from post-mortem human tissue. They developed a screening method to identify potential neural progenitor cells, ultimately pinpointing 354 such cells among nearly 300,000 human hippocampal cells from adolescents to septuagenarians. These cells possess the capacity to divide and generate new neurons in adulthood.

The study also revealed significant variability in the number of neural progenitor cells among individuals, suggesting strong environmental or physiological influences; younger individuals generally had more, but some adults showed none. It remains unclear whether these cells are newly generated in adulthood or have existed since infancy in an immature state. Shawn Sorrells, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh, noted that the algorithm might be identifying glial progenitor cells or even noise, emphasizing the need for further validation. This research provides new evidence for adult neurogenesis, and future goals include investigating the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis and its potential link to cognitive decline conditions like Alzheimer's disease, with hopes of identifying therapeutic targets.",2025-09-03 07:51:56

Pre-clinical studies demonstrated strong immunogenicity and efficacy in various animal models, promising effective prevention of hospital-acquired infections like sepsis and pneumonia in elderly and chronic disease patients. Wu acknowledged the significant challenges in CHO-V08's development, particularly concerning glycoconjugate technology, scalable process development, and CMC identification analysis. Recognizing RuenYat Biotechnology Inc.'s practical experience in glycoscience and biologics, GlycoNex partnered with RuenYat in 2022. RuenYat successfully facilitated the GMP production of CHO-V08's active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished product, passing stringent quality controls, leading to IND submissions in both the US and Taiwan. GlycoNex lauded RuenYat's reliability in customized materials, process development, aseptic filling, regulatory compliance, and timely delivery, expressing anticipation for future collaborations on higher valency bacterial vaccines and other biologics.",2025-09-03 08:00:37

This novel ageing clock offers a more advantageous method than traditional blood tests for assessing an individual's ageing progression and future risk of age-related diseases, including chronic illnesses and dementia. Led by Professor Ethan Whitman, the team initially focused on a cohort of over 1,000 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between 1972 and 1973. These participants underwent repeated measurements of 19 biological markers for cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, immune, dental, and pulmonary functions at ages 26, 32, 38, and 45. In the final follow-up, their brains were scanned using MRI. Data such as cortical thickness and gray matter volume were extracted from 860 brain images and fed into an algorithm, combined with data on the participants' age-related decline in cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune functions, to identify associations with ""ageing speed."" The findings were further validated using data from the UK Biobank (42,583 subjects) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, 1,737 brain scans). The research indicates that higher ageing clock scores correlate with an increased risk of future chronic diseases and mortality. Notably, within the ADNI group, individuals showing rapid ageing at the time of their first scan were potentially diagnosed with dementia within 16 years. While this new ageing clock holds immense potential, it remains a research tool. Further testing across diverse age groups and populations, alongside addressing data consistency issues across different scanning instruments, is required before it can be integrated into clinical applications.",2025-09-03 07:59:13

ivonescimab 原為中國康方生物 (Akeso) 的 AK112，Summit Therapeutics 於2022年12月以5億美元預付款、最高可達50億美元的總交易價值，取得其在美國、加拿大、歐洲和日本的獨家開發及商業化權利，創下中國新藥海外授權紀錄。該藥物已於去(2024)年6月獲得中國國家藥品監督管理局 (NMPA) 批准，可與化療聯合用於治療 EGFR 突變之非小細胞肺癌 (NSCLC) 的二線後治療，Summit 也預計在美國申請藥證。

ivonescimab 在臨床試驗中表現不一。在名為 HARMONi-2 的臨床三期試驗中，作為 NSCLC 的一線療法，其在無進展生存期 (PFS) 項目上超越了默沙東 (MSD) 的明星藥 Keytruda，因此被暱稱為「Keytruda 殺手」，但總體生存期 (OS) 未能展現顯著優勢。然而，今年5月底公布的 HARMONi 臨床三期試驗頂線數據結果則讓投資人感到不盡滿意，該試驗顯示 ivonescimab 與化療的合併療法雖可將 EGFR 突變之非小細胞肺癌二線後治療患者的疾病惡化或死亡風險降低48%，但生存率僅提高21%，未能達到統計學顯著差異。","On July 3rd, US time, foreign media reported that AstraZeneca (AZ) is in discussions with Summit Therapeutics for a mega-deal potentially worth up to $15 billion, with billions in upfront payments, to license the PD-1xVEGF bispecific antibody drug ivonescimab. Following this news, Summit's stock surged 9.7% to $25.81 in early trading that day. However, the news remains unconfirmed by both companies, and anonymous sources suggest Summit is also in talks with other pharmaceutical companies regarding ivonescimab's licensing.

ivonescimab was originally developed as AK112 by China's Akeso. Summit Therapeutics acquired exclusive development and commercialization rights in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan in December 2022 for a $500 million upfront payment and a total potential value of up to $5 billion, setting a record for Chinese new drug out-licensing. The drug received approval from China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in June 2024 for second-line treatment of EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy, and Summit plans to file for US approval.

Clinical trial results for ivonescimab have been mixed. In the HARMONi-2 Phase III trial, as a first-line therapy for NSCLC, it surpassed MSD's blockbuster drug Keytruda in progression-free survival (PFS), earning it the nickname ""Keytruda killer,"" though it did not show significant advantages in overall survival (OS). More recently, in late May, Summit released top-line data from its HARMONi Phase III trial, which disappointed investors. This trial, evaluating ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy for second-line EGFR-mutated NSCLC, showed a 48% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to chemotherapy alone, but only a 21% improvement in survival, which was not statistically significant.",2025-09-03 08:01:54

該法案提出多項變革：首先，受《平價醫療法案》(ACA)擴大涵蓋的2,000萬名被保險人將面臨每年至少兩次的資格審查，取代現行每年一次。其次，自2027年1月1日起，19至64歲成人（部分例外）須每月完成80小時工作、社區參與或教育課程，方符合資格。第三，限縮醫療提供者的稅務制度，強化聯邦對提供者稅的監管，並將6%的稅收上限改為依通膨調整，可能使各州更難取得額外補助資金。第四，設立500億美元鄉村醫院基金，協助受稅制變革影響的機構。第五，收緊移民申請資格，部分非公民將被排除。第六，強制對於收入超過聯邦貧窮線100%的「擴大計畫被保險人」徵收自負額，每項服務最高35美元。

分析師預估，法案實施後可能導致約500萬人退出醫療補助計畫，直接衝擊保險公司營收。其中，Molina Healthcare（88%會員來自Medicaid）、Centene（46%）和Elevance Health（19.5%）等業者將面臨顯著壓力。製藥公司方面，由於醫療補助在其美國銷售中佔比不到15%，預計受影響相對輕微。","On July 3rd, the U.S. House of Representatives passed President Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" by a narrow margin of 218 to 214 votes. The bill includes significant cuts to the federal Medicaid program, with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimating that approximately 12 million enrollees could lose their insurance coverage.

Key provisions of the bill include: stricter eligibility reviews, requiring states to conduct reviews at least twice annually for the 20 million Medicaid beneficiaries expanded under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), up from the current once a year. Starting January 1, 2027, adults aged 19 to 64 (with some exceptions) will be mandated to complete at least 80 hours per month of work, community engagement, or educational courses to qualify. The bill also tightens tax regulations for healthcare providers, adjusting the 6% cap on provider tax revenue to an inflation-indexed rate and limiting the types of services states can tax, potentially making it harder for states to secure additional federal Medicaid funding. Furthermore, it establishes a $50 billion rural hospital fund to support institutions potentially impacted by tax changes, toughens immigration requirements, excluding some non-citizens from Medicaid eligibility, and mandates co-payments for expanded program beneficiaries earning over 100% of the federal poverty line, with a maximum of $35 per service.

Analysts predict the bill could lead to a reduction of about 5 million Medicaid enrollees, directly impacting the revenues of health insurance companies. Carriers such as Molina Healthcare (over 88% of members from Medicaid), Centene (46%), and Elevance Health (19.5%) are expected to face significant financial pressure. Pharmaceutical companies, however, are anticipated to experience a relatively minor impact, as Medicaid typically accounts for less than 15% of their U.S. market sales.",2025-09-03 08:01:24

研究發現KIF2C在癌細胞中過度表現時會幫助腫瘤抵抗紫杉醇化療，是造成抗藥性的關鍵因子。因此，團隊合成出超過60種KIF2C小分子抑制劑，並成功開發出全球第一個具細胞穿透性的KIF2C小分子抑制劑BPRMC007S9。此藥物不僅展現強效的毒殺活性，更與紫杉醇併用時產生顯著協同效果，能有效抑制具抗藥性的腫瘤生長。

目前KIF2C抑制劑的應用範圍已從三陰性乳癌拓展至卵巢癌、子宮內膜癌與子宮頸癌等女性三大婦科癌症，並與清華學士後醫學系及林口長庚醫院婦癌科合作，期望提升病患治療成效。此外，指導實驗室成員已組成新創團隊「醫莉鎂生醫」，由本論文第一作者、清大分子與細胞生物所博士生包原韶擔任執行長。該團隊於2024年獲創新創業競賽金獎，並獲得國科會科研創業計畫支持，正積極將KIF2C小分子藥物推進臨床前試驗，邁向臨床應用。","The National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) and National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) jointly announced a significant research breakthrough today, developing a new targeted drug to combat cancer drug resistance. The research team, led by Professor Hui-Ching Wang and Chair Professor Yu-Chu Sun from NTHU's College of Biomedical Science, in collaboration with Director Hsing-Pang Hsieh from NHRI's Institute of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, successfully identified the motor protein KIF2C as a novel therapeutic target for drug-resistant cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

TNBC, accounting for 10-15% of all breast cancers, lacks hormone receptors and HER2 protein, making current targeted therapies ineffective. Patients often rely on traditional chemotherapy like paclitaxel but frequently experience recurrence, with recurrent tumors developing multi-drug resistance, leading to limited treatment options. The study found that overexpressed KIF2C in cancer cells helps tumors resist paclitaxel chemotherapy, making it a critical factor in drug resistance. In response, the team synthesized over 60 KIF2C small molecule inhibitors, leading to the development of BPRMC007S9, the world's first cell-permeable KIF2C small molecule inhibitor.

BPRMC007S9 demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity and significant synergistic effects when combined with paclitaxel, effectively suppressing drug-resistant tumor growth. The application of KIF2C inhibitors is now expanding from TNBC to three major gynecological cancers (ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers), in collaboration with NTHU's Post-Baccalaureate Program in Medicine and Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital's Department of Gynecologic Oncology, aiming to improve patient treatment outcomes. Furthermore, lab members involved formed a startup, ""醫莉鎂生醫"" (Yi Li Mei BioMed), led by Dr. Yuan-Shao Pao, the paper's first author. This team won a national innovation and entrepreneurship award in 2024 and secured funding from the National Science and Technology Council to advance the KIF2C small molecule drug into preclinical trials, moving towards clinical application.",2025-09-03 08:05:23

The research team discovered that CMV utilizes a unique protein complex called GATE (comprising gH, UL116, and UL141) to evade the human immune system's detection and successfully infect vascular cells. Specifically, UL141 was identified as a critical immune escape protein that helps the virus circumvent host defenses. This groundbreaking finding diverges from previous understandings that CMV primarily relies on the gH complex for invasion and could explain the past failures in CMV vaccine development. While CMV is a common herpesvirus infecting most adults globally, it poses severe threats to newborns (causing congenital defects) and immunocompromised patients, potentially leading to fatal outcomes for organ transplant recipients. The research team hopes this discovery will serve as a crucial target for developing next-generation CMV vaccines and antiviral drugs, offering a new opportunity to combat this pervasive and potentially dangerous virus.",2025-09-03 08:04:24

研究揭示，恢復肝醣磷解酶（Glycogen Phosphorylase, GlyP）活性，能分解累積的肝醣，並將糖分導向磷酸戊醣途徑（PPP），產生關鍵的抗氧化分子NADPH與麩胱甘肽。此舉不僅能有效清除有害的活性氧分子，減少tau蛋白相關損害，甚至能延長壽命。研究團隊更證實，透過飲食限制（DR）也能自然提高GlyP活性，改善tau蛋白病變；同時，使用8-Br-cAMP分子可模擬飲食限制效果，證明藥物干預的可能性，這也解釋了GLP-1類藥物在失智症治療上的潛力。此外，在額顳葉型失智症（FTD）患者的誘導性多潛能幹細胞（iPSC）分化神經元中，也觀察到相同的肝醣堆積與GlyP保護效果，強化了其臨床應用前景。這項發現不僅顛覆了對大腦肝醣的認知，也為從細胞內部代謝機制著手對抗老化和神經退化疾病開啟了新的治療途徑。","A new study by the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, published in Nature Metabolism, reveals that brain glycogen binds to tau protein, damaging neurons and offering a novel therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Traditionally, glycogen in the brain was thought to be minimal and confined to support cells like astrocytes. However, the research team, using fruit fly and human tauopathy models, discovered an abnormal accumulation of large amounts of glycogen in neurons. Tau protein binds to this glycogen, preventing its breakdown, which accelerates disease progression. This impaired glycogen breakdown also compromises a crucial neuronal defense mechanism against oxidative stress, a hallmark of aging and neurodegeneration.

The study found that restoring the activity of Glycogen Phosphorylase (GlyP) can initiate glycogen breakdown and channel the sugars into the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP). The PPP generates critical reducing agents like NADPH and glutathione, enhancing the brain's antioxidant capacity. This process not only reduced tau-related damage in both fruit flies and human stem cell-derived neurons but also extended lifespan in models. Furthermore, the team demonstrated that dietary restriction (DR) naturally increases GlyP activity and ameliorates tauopathy. They also showed that the molecule 8-Br-cAMP can mimic the beneficial effects of DR pharmacologically, which may explain the observed potential of GLP-1 class drugs, widely used for weight loss, in treating dementia. The same glycogen accumulation and GlyP protective effects were observed in iPSC-derived neurons from Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) patients, further supporting the clinical relevance of these findings. This research fundamentally changes our understanding of brain glycogen's role in pathology and opens new avenues for developing therapies that target cellular metabolic pathways to combat aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",2025-09-03 08:04:14

This approval is for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, making it the first FDA-approved BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody. The accelerated approval was based on results from the LINKER-MM1 Phase 1/2 clinical trial, which demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 70% among 80 patients, with 45% achieving a complete response (CR) or better. The median time to first response was 0.95 months. Andres Sirulnik, Regeneron's Head of Hematology Clinical Development, expressed the company's ambition to explore the potential of these powerful bispecific antibodies for front-line treatment and as standard therapy for multiple myeloma. While two other bispecific antibodies, Johnson & Johnson's Tecvayli and Pfizer's Elrexfio, are already approved for multiple myeloma, Lynozyfic is distinct as the first specifically targeting BCMAxCD3. The FDA has mandated boxed warnings for all three drugs, including Lynozyfic, due to risks of neurotoxicity and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). According to the American Cancer Society, over 36,000 new multiple myeloma cases are estimated in the U.S. in 2025, with Regeneron projecting approximately 4,000 patients having received four or more prior lines of therapy, potentially qualifying for Lynozyfic.",2025-09-03 08:03:59

除了先為達生物科技，中國多家藥廠也在積極投入新一代GLP-1藥物的開發。例如，信達生物與禮來合作開發的mazdutide，能同時模仿GLP-1與升糖素的作用，在36週內可減少約15%體重，並降低心血管疾病風險，目前正探索其治療睡眠呼吸中止症或第二型糖尿病的潛力。其他開發中的藥物還包括聯邦生物研發並授權給諾和諾德的GIP/GLP-1/升糖素三重受體促效劑UBT251（已完成臨床一b期試驗），以及北京甘李藥業的GLP-1藥物Bofanglutide（已進入臨床二期試驗）。香港的歌禮製藥則正向美國FDA申請進行其每日口服GLP-1藥物ASC30的臨床二期試驗，顯示中國在GLP-1藥物領域的創新與追趕態勢。","Sciwind Biosciences, a Chinese biotechnology company based in Hangzhou, recently announced the Phase III clinical trial results for its novel GLP-1 drug, ecnoglutide. The findings were published in the international journal, The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology. The trial involved 664 obese or overweight adults, demonstrating that weekly injections of ecnoglutide led to an average weight reduction of 13.2% in the high-dose group over 40 weeks, significantly outperforming the 0.1% reduction in the placebo group. Ecnoglutide distinguishes itself by preferentially activating the intracellular cAMP signaling pathway, thereby regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, which in turn suppresses appetite, controls blood sugar, and promotes weight loss. The study also indicated that ecnoglutide can improve cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, while effectively reducing liver fat accumulation.

Beyond Sciwind Biosciences, several other Chinese pharmaceutical companies are actively developing next-generation GLP-1 drugs. For instance, Innovent Biologics, in partnership with Eli Lilly, is developing mazdutide, which mimics both GLP-1 and glucagon actions. This drug has shown a 15% weight reduction over 36 weeks and reduced cardiovascular disease risk, with ongoing investigations into its potential for treating sleep apnea or type 2 diabetes. Other drugs in development include Federal Bio's UBT251, a GIP/GLP-1/glucagon triple receptor agonist licensed to Novo Nordisk (completed Phase Ib), and Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals' GLP-1 drug Bofanglutide (entered Phase II). Additionally, Hong Kong-based Ascletis Pharma Inc. is applying to the US FDA for a Phase II trial of its daily oral GLP-1 drug, ASC30, underscoring China's innovative and competitive drive in the GLP-1 drug landscape.",2025-09-03 08:03:47

The study analyzed the expression of 19 cytokines in the blood of nearly 3,000 participants from Italy, Singapore, Bolivia, and Malaysia. Findings revealed that participants from Italy and Singapore exhibited a steady increase in cytokine concentrations with age, which was correlated with chronic conditions such as kidney disease, consistent with prior research. However, indigenous populations from Bolivia and Malaysia, despite having higher baseline cytokine levels, did not show age-related increases or links to diseases; these elevated levels were likely natural immune responses to common infections. Thomas McDade, a biological anthropologist from Northwestern University, hypothesized that lifestyle factors in industrialized societies—including diet, reduced physical activity, and stress—might negatively impact the body's ability to regulate inflammation, whereas indigenous communities appear to have more tightly regulated immune systems. This research emphasizes that inflammatory proteins are not inherently harmful and their roles may vary significantly across different environments, paving new, more nuanced directions for future studies on aging mechanisms.",2025-09-03 08:03:13

The research, led by Professor Chiu Han-Mo from National Taiwan University College of Medicine and Professor Chen Hsiu-Hsi from the College of Public Health, tracked over 500,000 individuals aged 40-49 in Keelung and Tainan cities. Findings revealed that the early screening group (starting at 40-49) had a colorectal cancer incidence rate of 26.1 cases per 100,000 person-years, significantly lower than the 42.6 cases for those starting at 50. Mortality rates also dropped from 7.4 to 3.2 cases per 100,000 person-years, a reduction of over 50%. After adjusting for various factors, early screening reduced colorectal cancer incidence risk by 21-25% and mortality risk by 34-39%. The study further indicated that early screening could prevent one colorectal cancer case for every 1,548 individuals screened, outperforming the 2,079 individuals required for screening starting at age 50. Harvard University experts commented that this observational study provides crucial scientific evidence for colorectal cancer screening policies in younger populations, aligning with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's (USPSTF) recommendation to lower the screening age to 45 since 2021. Professor Chiu emphasized the profound impact of this strategy on the highly productive 40-49 age group, especially given Taiwan's current status among the top three countries globally for colorectal cancer incidence in this demographic. The study is expected to serve as a significant reference for prospective screening age standards.",2025-09-03 08:02:33

(免疫功坊) 於今(1)日宣布，其自主研發的長效型奧曲肽新藥TE-8214已在澳洲順利完成臨床一期試驗，結果顯示該藥安全性與耐受性良好，並可達成預期的藥理機制，且能透過皮下注射輕易施打，不產生施打部位副作用。免疫功坊目前正積極籌備臨床二期試驗，預計於2025年第三季在臺灣啟動。

TE-8214運用免疫功坊的專利平台技術，在奧曲肽分子上連結脂肪酸束，以延長藥物半衰期，主要應用於治療肢端肥大症與多種神經內分泌腫瘤(NET)所引致的病徵。公司強調，相較於現有市售產品多為高黏稠度微粒或凝膠狀緩釋劑型，需使用粗針頭進行肌肉或深層皮下注射，易引發疼痛與結節，導致病患接受度與依從性下降；TE-8214具備高水溶性，可透過30G細針頭進行皮下注射，大幅減輕患者的疼痛與恐懼感，此關鍵優勢將有助於其積極拓展全球奧曲肽市場。

臨床一期試驗採雙盲、單劑量遞增設計，設有四個劑量組別，每組納入8名健康受試者。結果顯示TE-8214整體耐受性良好，僅出現輕微不良反應，未觀察到任何嚴重不良事件。特別針對奧曲肽常見的消化道不良反應，24位TE-8214受試者中僅3人出現極輕微不適；更重要的是，所有TE-8214受試者均未出現注射部位疼痛或結節，證實其劑型設計成功解決了緩釋劑型的痛點。此外，高劑量組別中有83%的TE-8214受試者其類胰島素生長因子(IGF-1)濃度下降超過20%，顯示其顯著的IGF-1抑制效果，支持其作為治療用藥的潛力。","ImmunoPrecise Co., Ltd., founded by ""Father of Taiwan Antibodies"" Chang, Tzu-Wen, announced today the successful completion of a Phase I clinical trial in Australia for its independently developed long-acting octreotide new drug, TE-8214. Results demonstrated good safety and tolerability for TE-8214, achieving its expected pharmacological mechanism, and allowing for easy subcutaneous injection without site-specific side effects. ImmunoPrecise is now actively preparing for a Phase II trial, which is anticipated to commence in Taiwan in the third quarter of 2025.

TE-8214 utilizes ImmunoPrecise's proprietary platform technology, which involves linking a fatty acid bundle to the octreotide molecule to extend its half-life. It is designed to treat symptoms associated with acromegaly and various neuroendocrine tumors (NET). The company highlighted that existing market products often involve high-viscosity microparticle or gel sustained-release formulations, requiring large needles (19G or 20G) for intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injections, which can cause pain and nodules, leading to reduced patient acceptance and adherence. In contrast, TE-8214's high water solubility allows for subcutaneous injection with a fine 30G needle, significantly alleviating patient pain and fear. This key advantage is expected to facilitate its aggressive expansion into the global octreotide market.

The Phase I trial was a double-blind, single ascending dose design across four dose groups, each enrolling eight healthy subjects. Overall, TE-8214 was well-tolerated, with only mild adverse reactions and no serious adverse events observed. Notably, regarding common octreotide-related gastrointestinal adverse reactions, only 3 out of 24 TE-8214 subjects experienced very mild discomfort. More importantly, no TE-8214 subjects experienced injection site pain or nodules, confirming that its formulation design successfully addressed the major drawbacks of sustained-release formulations. Furthermore, in the high-dose groups, 83% of TE-8214 subjects demonstrated over a 20% reduction in insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration, indicating significant IGF-1 inhibitory effects and supporting its therapeutic potential.",2025-09-03 08:09:50

This strategic move aims to secure Capstan's in vivo CAR-T cell platform technologies and various autoimmune disease drug candidates, marking AbbVie's full entry into the in vivo CAR-T cell therapy market. Under the agreement, AbbVie will gain CPTX2309, an in vivo anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy candidate currently in Phase 1 clinical trials, along with several preclinical programs and technology platforms for developing additional potential therapies. CPTX2309 initiated clinical trials in healthy volunteers in Australia in April, with dosage evaluation underway to inform future Phase 2 trials for autoimmune diseases. CPTX2309 utilizes lipid nanoparticles (LNP) encapsulating anti-CD19 CAR mRNA, featuring a CD8 targeting antibody design to precisely deliver the payload to CD8-positive T cells, converting them into therapeutically potent CAR-T cells. The in vivo CAR-T therapy strategy offers a significant advantage by bypassing the complex ex vivo procedures of cell extraction, laboratory modification, and pre-conditioning chemotherapy. Besides Capstan, other companies focusing on in vivo CAR-T therapy development include Interius BioTherapeutics and Umoja Biopharma. However, these companies employ different technologies, using lentiviral vectors to directly introduce genes into cells in vivo to induce CAR-T cell production, with their current therapies primarily targeting cancer, differing from Capstan's LNP-based approach.",2025-09-03 08:09:07

These unique compounds, synthesized by ribosomes and modified by enzymes, possess a distinctive seven-ring scaffold structure, which is rare in fungi. The study demonstrated that two Asperigimycins variants exhibited high efficacy and specificity against leukemia cells, comparable to existing FDA-approved leukemia drugs such as cytarabine and daunorubicin. Notably, a lipid-modified variant showed enhanced potency. The mechanism of action involves disrupting 'tubulin,' essential for cancer cell division, thereby inhibiting proliferation. This discovery not only opens new avenues for treating blood-related cancers but also suggests the potential for more RiPP molecules with therapeutic promise to be found in nature.",2025-09-03 08:08:54

該大規模臨床三期試驗為隨機分配、觀察者盲性、主動對照研究，共招募11個國家40,805名50歲以上成人，受試者隨機接種單劑量mRN1010或標準劑量疫苗並追蹤6個月。結果顯示，mRN1010在所有流感病毒株的相對疫苗效力（rVE）均優於標準劑量流感疫苗，整體rVE達26.6%。具體而言，季節性A型H1N1流感病毒株的rVE為29.6%、A型H3N2為22.2%、B型Victoria流感病毒株為29.1%。尤其在65歲以上高齡族群中，mRN1010的rVE更高達27.4%。安全性方面，mRN1010耐受性表現與先前試驗一致，多數不良反應為輕微，最常見局部反應為注射部位疼痛，而全身性反應以疲倦、頭痛和肌肉痠痛為主。

莫德納執行長Stéphane Bancel指出，mRNA平台開發的流感疫苗能更精準匹配流行病毒株，並具備迅速應對未來流感大流行的潛力，同時也可開發新一代新冠肺炎複合疫苗。莫德納計畫在即將舉行的醫學會議上發表相關數據，並將啟動mRN1010的監管申請審查流程。","Moderna announced on June 30th (US time) the positive results of its Phase 3 clinical trial for its mRNA influenza vaccine, mRN1010. The trial, conducted with 40,000 participants aged 50 and above, showed that mRN1010 demonstrated 26.6% higher efficacy compared to GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) approved flu vaccine. This news led to a more than 2% increase in Moderna's stock price, which had been under pressure due to declining COVID-19 vaccine sales, lower-than-expected uptake of its RSV vaccine, and a 35% year-to-date stock decline, making this new mRNA vaccine's success crucial for the company.

The large-scale Phase 3 trial was a randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled study involving 40,805 adults aged 50 and older across 11 countries. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of mRN1010 or an approved standard-dose vaccine and were followed for six months. Results indicated that mRN1010 exhibited superior relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) across all influenza strains compared to the standard-dose vaccine, with an overall rVE of 26.6%. Specifically, the rVE for seasonal influenza A (H1N1) was 29.6%, for influenza A (H3N2) was 22.2%, and for influenza B (Victoria) was 29.1%. Notably, in the elderly population aged 65 and above, mRN1010's rVE reached 27.4%. Safety data showed that mRN1010 was well-tolerated, consistent with previous trials, with injection site pain being the most common local adverse reaction, and fatigue, headache, and myalgia as the most frequent systemic reactions.

Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel emphasized the mRNA platform's capability to precisely match circulating influenza strains and rapidly respond to future pandemics, also noting its potential for developing next-generation COVID-19 combination vaccines. Moderna plans to present these data at upcoming medical conferences, publish them in journals, and initiate the regulatory review process for mRN1010.",2025-09-03 08:08:44

Their findings reveal that cancer cells form ultrafine tunnels to steal mitochondria from nerve cells, thereby enhancing their ability to navigate blood vessels and withstand environmental stress. This 'mitochondrial theft' appears to be a crucial factor in cancer progression. The team developed a reporter gene tool called MitoTRACER to permanently label cancer cells that acquire mitochondria from other cells. In studies involving mice with aggressive breast cancer, inhibiting neural function with Botulinum neurotoxin A significantly reduced cancer cell metabolic activity, demonstrating the nervous system's influence on tumor metabolism. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that cancer cells extend tube-like structures to siphon off mitochondria from nerve cells, subsequently generating more energy and exhibiting higher survival rates when subjected to physical stress (simulating blood flow) and chemical stress (hydrogen peroxide). Notably, while only a small fraction of cancer cells in primary breast tumors steal mitochondria, the proportion significantly increases in tumors that metastasize to the brain. Observations in human tissues also indicated that metastatic tumors generally contain more mitochondria than primary tumors, strongly suggesting that this mitochondrial acquisition facilitates successful cancer metastasis. This research not only uncovers a new potential mechanism for cancer metastasis but also offers promising new targets for future cancer therapies.",2025-09-03 08:11:38

The research highlights that mammals have limited regenerative capacities, and previous methods such as stem cell therapy or gene editing have not fully restored organ function. The team compared rabbits, capable of regenerating earlobes, with mice, which cannot. They found that rabbits form a blastema upon earlobe injury and activate the Aldh1a2 gene, rapidly converting retinal to RA, thereby promoting new tissue regeneration. In contrast, mice exhibit low Aldh1a2 expression and rapid RA degradation, leading to insufficient RA for regeneration. Further investigation showed that mice's regeneration failure was not due to an inability to form a blastema, but rather different responses from wound-induced fibroblasts (WIFs). Importantly, researchers successfully restored earlobe regeneration in mice by injecting exogenous RA or by using a rabbit enhancer to activate mouse Aldh1a2, which promoted WIFs to form new tissue. This breakthrough offers a novel approach to organ regeneration and holds significant promise for advancing regenerative medicine in the future.",2025-09-03 08:11:25

The model aims to understand how these sequences function in cancer and within cells. Previously considered 'junk DNA,' these non-coding genes are now known to influence the activity of protein-coding genes. AlphaGenome builds on the success of DeepMind's AlphaFold2 (launched in 2020, which solved protein structure prediction) by training on human and mouse data. It aims to be a versatile, comprehensive AI model capable of predicting gene expression and function. This 'sequence-to-function' model can process up to one million sequences simultaneously, making thousands of predictions, and is sensitive enough to detect single base mutations. For example, it accurately predicted that non-coding mutations in leukemia patients would activate nearby genes. Despite its capabilities, AlphaGenome faces limitations such as restricted data sources, an inability to fully predict complex disease risks, an incomplete understanding of how cellular changes affect sequence function, and a need for improved accuracy in regulating genes exceeding 100,000 base pairs. Peter Koo, a computational biologist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, suggests future research will leverage AlphaGenome to design new DNA regulatory sequences.

此次加速批准是基於臨床三期試驗的池化數據及一項臨床二期試驗的次族群分析結果。在114名患者中，Datroway達成了45%的客觀緩解率（ORR），其中4.4%的患者達到完全緩解，中位緩解時間為6.5個月。儘管後續仍需進行確認性試驗以取得完全批准，但這項批准對於進軍晚期EGFR突變肺癌市場而言，是關鍵的一步，因為此類患者在現有療法後線選擇相當有限。

隨著此次批准，阿斯特捷利康將向第一三共支付4500萬美元，而Datroway在美國的銷售將由第一三共負責。Datroway是兩公司繼明星藥Enhertu（2024年銷售額達37.5億美元）之後的第二款ADC藥物。兩家公司正積極透過廣泛的臨床試驗計畫，探索Datroway在乳癌及其他癌症的應用前景，並已於今年1月獲得FDA批准用於治療部分類型的乳癌。此外，兩公司也正期待Datroway與阿斯特捷利康的免疫療法藥物Imfinzi合併用於NSCLC一線治療的臨床試驗結果。","On June 23rd, U.S. time, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo jointly announced that their co-developed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) new drug, Datroway (Dato-DXd), has received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This approval is for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients who have previously undergone EGFR-targeted therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. Datroway thus becomes the first TROP2-targeted NSCLC therapy in the United States.

The accelerated approval was based on pooled data from a Phase 3 clinical trial combined with a sub-population analysis from a Phase 2 trial. Among 114 patients, Datroway achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 45%, with 4.4% of patients achieving complete remission and a median duration of response of 6.5 months. While confirmatory trials are still required for full approval, this milestone represents a crucial step into the advanced EGFR-mutated lung cancer market, where treatment options are severely limited for patients after initial therapies.

Following this approval, AstraZeneca will pay Daiichi Sankyo $45 million, with Daiichi Sankyo taking responsibility for Datroway's sales in the U.S. Datroway is the second ADC drug from the two companies, following the blockbuster Enhertu, which generated $3.75 billion in sales in 2024. Both companies are committed to exploring Datroway's potential applications in breast cancer and other cancers through extensive clinical trial programs, having already secured FDA approval for certain types of breast cancer in January this year. Furthermore, they are awaiting results from clinical trials evaluating Datroway in combination with AstraZeneca's immunotherapy drug Imfinzi for first-line NSCLC treatment.",2025-09-03 08:17:43

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. further accused GAVI of neglecting vaccine safety issues and suppressing dissenting opinions, though he provided no explicit evidence. This announcement came during GAVI's pledging summit in Brussels, co-hosted by the European Union and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which aims to raise $9 billion to vaccinate an additional 500 million children and save at least 8 million lives between 2026 and 2030. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation spearheaded pledges by committing $1.6 billion in public-private partnership funds to GAVI over the next five years. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., long regarded as an anti-vaccine advocate, reiterated his accusations in a video statement played at the summit, criticizing GAVI for questionable recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccines, disregarding science, and expressing concerns about the whole-cell diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTPw) vaccine. He urged GAVI to regain public trust, consider all available scientific evidence, and justify the $8 billion the U.S. has provided since 2001, stating that the U.S. will not make further contributions until then. In response, GAVI issued a statement affirming the paramount importance of vaccine safety, its commitment to children's health, and that its actions align with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, expressing confidence in the DTPw vaccine. This decision follows a March report indicating that the Trump administration had planned to end its annual $300 million funding for GAVI. Despite former President Biden's prior commitment of $1.58 billion to GAVI, the future of that pledge remains uncertain.",2025-09-03 08:17:01

Professor Witwer provided an in-depth analysis of the biodistribution, immunogenicity, drug delivery potential, and future challenges of extracellular vesicles (EVs). He highlighted that while exosomes are highly anticipated as drug carriers, they face numerous challenges and misconceptions, particularly regarding the high heterogeneity of EVs from different sources, indicating that not all EVs can achieve ideal delivery efficacy. Witwer explained that EV is a general term for various extracellular vesicles, acting as a 'platform' with diverse origins, including extensions from the plasma membrane or from within cells. His laboratory's early research showed that intravenously injected EVs have a half-life of approximately 30-40 minutes in non-human primates, significantly longer than the 5-10 minutes observed in mouse studies. EVs primarily distribute in the liver, spleen, and lungs, necessitating specific modifications for targeted organ therapy. Furthermore, studies revealed that EVs bind to B cells far more extensively than previously thought, challenging the misconception that EVs are non-immunogenic due to their small size (2-200 nm). His team's bacterial EV-based COVID-19 vaccine trial in hamsters during the pandemic significantly prevented weight loss. In primate trials, repeated administration of human-derived exosomes elicited significant IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses, with a substantial decrease in half-life. He thus stressed the critical importance of rigorously evaluating EV immunogenicity before therapeutic application. Finally, he cautioned that current EV research might overlook the significance of the ""EV Corona"" formed on the EV surface, as it may be the primary source of EV activity. His team's research confirmed that CD39 and CD73 expression on the EV surface exhibits anti-inflammatory functions, advocating for a dual focus on both the internal cargo delivery capabilities of EVs and the interactions between their surface structures and biological systems.",2025-09-03 08:21:12

Professor Schekman shared the unique role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in secreting and membrane proteins, along with his latest insights into EV's function in Parkinson's disease pathology. Randy Schekman is currently a professor at UC Berkeley and a researcher at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. During the forum, it was announced that he will serve as an international consultant for exosome research and development for China Medical University Hospital and St. Ann BioScience (6926). His advisory role will focus on providing critical academic guidance and global resource connections for the SOB100 exosome platform, which is the world's first engineered exosome technology targeting HLG tumor antigens, aimed at accelerating new exosome drug development. Professor Schekman's research indicates that EVs (including microvesicles and exosomes) are a non-traditional transport mechanism for secreted and membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells. Their secretion is significantly stimulated when cell membranes are damaged, suggesting a common mechanism to help damaged cells expel unwanted substances. In recent years, his team has focused on the link between α-synuclein (α-syn) and Parkinson's disease, discovering that α-syn may undergo transmembrane translocation via exosomes, subsequently spreading or aggregating in the brain, which is believed to be one cause of the pathological spread of Parkinson's disease.

TML-6是美力齡開發的全新專利口服小分子新藥，透過多重標靶機制治療阿茲海默症，已在美國完成臨床一期試驗。美力齡已就TML-6初步資料諮詢美國FDA並獲正面回應，現規劃在全球(美國、瑞典、臺灣) 19個醫學中心進行210名受試者的臨床二期試驗，並委由Syneos CRO公司向各國主管機關提出申請。
蘇益仁指出，臨床二期試驗將以血中生物標記p-tau217篩選患者並評估療效，目標是證實TML-6能穩定並改善輕度認知功能障礙或早期阿茲海默症的病程。他強調TML-6具備抗氧化、抗老化、維持細胞自噬溶小體等多重作用機制，是全球首款調控阿茲海默症致病機轉的新藥，有望帶來治療典範轉移。
此外，美力齡於6月宣布其針對阿茲海默症高風險族群開發的預防保健產品人體試驗數據，結果顯示血中p-tau217含量顯著下降且具劑量效應，此數據亦將作為TML-6新藥臨床試驗的重要參考。
Gary Small表示，蘇益仁教授受其薑黃素研究啟發，雙方已研究合作6年。他的研究發現薑黃素能抗類澱粉蛋白、抗tau蛋白，並減少氧化壓力與發炎反應。他強調阿茲海默症應早期介入，並提及與日本Theravalues公司合作開發高生物利用率的Theracurmin薑黃素，並設計長達18個月的試驗期，透過PET掃描觀察類澱粉蛋白和tau蛋白變化。Gary Small指出，2018年試驗結果顯示Theracurmin對記憶有顯著效果，並預計今年將在加州UCLA與新澤西州Hackensack Meridian Health展開驗證研究。他認為美力齡開發的TML-6將其研究提升至新層次，臨床二期試驗將進一步開發針對早期阿茲海默症的新型有效療法。","On June 23rd, ML BioMed Inc. held its shareholder meeting and award ceremony, where General Manager Su Yi-Ren reported on the upcoming global Phase II clinical trials for its new Alzheimer's drug, TML-6, and presented human trial data for its Alzheimer's preventive health product. The company specifically invited Dr. Gary Small, a dementia expert from UCLA, to serve as the chief consultant for TML-6's Phase II trials, recognizing his pioneering work on synthetic curcumin analogues for Alzheimer's treatment.
TML-6, a novel patented oral small molecule drug developed by ML BioMed Inc., treats Alzheimer's through multiple mechanisms of action and has successfully completed Phase I trials in the United States. ML BioMed Inc. has consulted with the U.S. FDA regarding preliminary data for TML-6, receiving a positive response that only written documentation is required for application. The company is now planning global Phase II trials involving 210 subjects across 19 medical centers in the United States, Sweden, and Taiwan, with Syneos Health selected to formally submit applications to regulatory bodies including the FDA, TFDA, and EU.
Su Yi-Ren emphasized that the Phase II trials would use blood biomarkers, specifically p-tau217, for patient selection and as a primary efficacy endpoint. The goal is to demonstrate that TML-6 can stabilize and improve the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early-stage Alzheimer's disease. He highlighted TML-6 as a paradigm-shifting new drug, being the world's first with antioxidant, anti-aging, and autolysosome maintenance functions, regulating Alzheimer's pathogenic mechanisms through multiple targets.
Furthermore, ML BioMed Inc. announced in June the human trial data for its preventive health product targeting high-risk Alzheimer's populations. The results showed a significant, dose-dependent decrease in blood p-tau217 levels in the health product group, providing crucial clinical reference for the TML-6 new drug trials.
Dr. Gary Small indicated that Professor Su Yi-Ren was inspired by his curcumin research, leading to a six-year research collaboration. Small's research has shown curcumin's ability to combat amyloid and tau proteins, reduce oxidative stress, and inflammation. He stressed the importance of early intervention for Alzheimer's and mentioned his collaboration with the Japanese company Theravalues, which developed high-bioavailability curcumin (Theracurmin). His research design included longer treatment durations (18 months) and used PET scans with FDDNP markers to observe changes in amyloid and tau proteins in the brain. Small noted that his 2018 trial results demonstrated significant memory improvement with Theracurmin and observable changes in amyloid and tau signals in the brain. He anticipates commencing validation studies this year at UCLA in California and Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey. Small believes that ML BioMed Inc.'s synthetic curcumin analogue, TML-6, elevates his research to a new level, with the ongoing Phase II trials poised to further develop novel and effective therapies for early Alzheimer's disease.",2025-09-03 08:25:51

Sage Therapeutics自2014年由Third Rock Ventures創立，專注於開發腦部疾病藥物，其股價曾因兩款抗憂鬱新藥進入臨床試驗而飆漲。儘管其靜脈注射藥物Zulresso曾是全球首個獲FDA批准治療產後憂鬱症的藥物，但因60小時靜脈注射要求接受度不高，已於2024年底退出市場。而後上市的口服藥Zurzuvae於2023年獲批，成為目前市場上唯一用於治療產後憂鬱症的上市藥物，2024年銷售額為7,220萬美元，並與百健簽有數十億美元合作協議。

然而，Sage在重度憂鬱症(MDD)領域拓展失利，且在癲癇、顫抖症、阿茲海默症、亨丁頓舞蹈症、帕金森氏症等領域的藥物研發也遭遇挫敗。上週五Sage股價收於每股6.70美元，顯著的跌幅促使董事會認為百健先前的報價過低。分析師Stifel的Paul Matteis指出，此次併購價格對曾是腦科學藥物熱門新創的Sage而言令人失望，但對面臨挑戰的股東來說仍是不錯的結局。RBC Capital Markets的Brian Abrahams則認為，Sage實現所有CVR里程碑的機率極低，需在2027年、2028年及2030年分別達成2.5億、3億及3.75億美元的Zurzuvae美國銷售額，以及Zurzuvae獲日本批准治療重度憂鬱症，才能完全實現CVR。","Supernus Pharmaceuticals announced its acquisition of biotech firm Sage Therapeutics for $561 million, or $8.50 per share, with an additional contingent value rights (CVR) package potentially increasing the total value to $795 million. The deal is expected to close in Q3 2025. Sage shareholders could receive up to an additional $3.50 per share if Zurzuvae, Sage's only FDA-approved oral treatment for postpartum depression (PPD), meets specific sales and commercial milestones. This acquisition follows Sage's rejection of a $469 million, or $7.22 per share, offer from its development partner and 10.2% shareholder Biogen in January, with Sage subsequently suing Biogen for undervaluing the company.

Founded in 2014 by Third Rock Ventures, Sage Therapeutics focused on developing drugs for brain disorders, including epilepsy, tremor, and Huntington’s disease. Its stock price once surged as two antidepressant new drugs entered clinical trials. While its intravenous drug Zulresso was the world's first FDA-approved treatment for PPD, its requirement for 60 hours of IV administration in a medical setting led to low market acceptance, and it was withdrawn by the end of 2024. Its oral counterpart, Zurzuvae, approved in 2023, is now the only FDA-approved oral medication for PPD on the market, generating $72.2 million in sales in 2024 and being part of a multi-billion dollar collaboration with Biogen.

However, Sage faced setbacks in expanding Zurzuvae for major depressive disorder (MDD), with the FDA requiring additional clinical trials, leading to a strategy change and layoffs. The company also experienced failures in drug development for other conditions such as epilepsy, tremor, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's disease. Sage's stock closed at $6.70 per share last Friday, reflecting significant recent declines that led its board to deem Biogen's earlier offer insufficient. Stifel analyst Paul Matteis noted that the acquisition price was somewhat disappointing for what was once a hot startup in brain science drug development, but still represents a good outcome for Sage shareholders facing numerous challenges. Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets opined that the probability of Sage achieving all CVR milestones is very low, as it requires Zurzuvae's U.S. sales to reach $250 million by 2027, $300 million by 2028, and $375 million by 2030, in addition to Japanese regulatory approval for Zurzuvae in MDD.",2025-09-03 08:28:15

The Korea Pavilion, organized by the Korea Biotechnology Industry Organization and the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, featured 51 participating companies, nearly doubling its 2024 scale. Including 15 companies with independent booths, such as Samsung Biologics, Celltrion, SK Biologics, Lotte Biologics, Dong-A Socio Group, Prestige BioPharma Group, and EuBiologics, over 80 Korean companies participated, solidifying South Korea's position as Asia's largest in biotech development.

Influenced by the Trump administration's drug pricing policies and trade tariffs, many major pharmaceutical companies were notably absent from this year's exhibition, making the CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) sector the most dominant area. Driven by South Korea's robust performance in CMO/CDMO, major players like Samsung Biologics and Celltrion, along with emerging small and medium-sized CDMO enterprises, are not only expanding their core businesses in contract manufacturing and biosimilars but also venturing into advanced medical technologies such as CAR-T, nucleic acids, CRISPR, and CGT.

KoreaBio emphasized that with global investment and attention continuously increasing in life sciences, South Korea recognizes the limited time it has to secure a significant position in the global biotech field, especially against emerging markets like India and Thailand. Therefore, strategic positioning and active improvement in the quality and quantity of technologies are crucial for Korean companies.

Specific company initiatives include Samsung Biologics' expansion into the CRO (Contract Research Organization) sector, offering comprehensive one-stop services from early drug development to preclinical and Phase I clinical trials. Samsung Biologics also debuted a new drug screening service utilizing organoids. Lotte Biologics is upgrading its ADC (Antibody-Drug Conjugate) facilities in Syracuse, New York, and expanding its development plans at the Songdo bio complex in Incheon, which has become the world's largest biopharmaceutical production hub with 1.2 million liters in capacity. Celltrion highlighted its competitiveness in next-generation drug development, including ADCs and novel antibody therapies, with its ADC candidate CT-P70 receiving US FDA approval for Phase I clinical trials in March. Geopolitical tensions were also evident, with WuXi Biologics, South Korea's largest competitor in CRO/CDMO, absent for the second consecutive year, providing a significant opportunity for Korean firms, including emerging small and medium-sized CDMOs, to showcase their capabilities and expand their business endeavors.",2025-09-03 08:32:59

Verve曾因LNP載體問題中止VERVE-101的臨床一期試驗，但隨後將重點轉向使用不同LNP載體傳送同樣靶向PCSK9的VERVE-102。2025年4月公布的VERVE-102早期試驗數據顯示，其能有效降低LDL膽固醇和PCSK9，且未引發肝臟酵素升高。VERVE-102目前正進行臨床一b期試驗，預計今年下半年啟動臨床二期，並有望治療異質型家族性高膽固醇血症(HeFH)。禮來副總裁Ruth Gimeno表示，VERVE-102有望成為首個針對大眾的體內基因編輯療法，可望將心血管疾病的治療模式從慢性管理轉變為一次性治癒。William Blair分析師預期，禮來很可能重組原有授權合作協議。
禮來今年出手積極，除了此次收購Verve，年初已斥資25億美元收購Scorpion Therapeutics的PI3Kα產品線，上個月又以高達10億美元收購SiteOne Therapeutics，將其非鴉片類止痛劑納入產品線。此次收購消息也激勵了整個基因編輯股票市場，Intellia Therapeutics、Beam Therapeutics和Editas Medicines等公司的股價在盤前均有所上漲。","Eli Lilly officially announced on June 17 (US time) its acquisition of gene editing partner Verve Therapeutics for a total of US$1.3 billion, or US$13.5 per share, representing a 113% premium over Verve's 30-day average closing price. Following the news, Verve's stock surged 81.5% to close at US$11.38.
The upfront payment for the acquisition will be approximately US$1 billion (US$10.5 per share). Additionally, Verve shareholders will receive an extra US$3 per share as a Contingent Value Right (CVR) if Verve's gene editing therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, VERVE-102, enters Phase 3 clinical trials in the US and administers the first patient within 10 years.
The partnership between Eli Lilly and Verve began in June 2023, when Eli Lilly provided a US$60 million upfront payment and equity investment, plus up to US$465 million in milestones, to gain access to Verve's gene editing technology for developing therapies targeting lipoprotein(a) in cardiovascular diseases. In November of the same year, Eli Lilly also paid US$250 million to Beam Therapeutics to join Beam and Verve's base editing collaboration, which started in 2019 and focuses on gene therapy programs for PCSK9, ANGPTL3, and other targets.
Verve had previously halted Phase 1 trials for VERVE-101 due to elevated liver enzymes attributed to its lipid nanoparticle (LNP) carrier. Subsequently, the company shifted its focus to VERVE-102, which uses a different LNP carrier but targets the same PCSK9. Early trial data for VERVE-102, released in April 2025, showed its ability to reduce LDL cholesterol and PCSK9 without causing elevated liver enzymes. VERVE-102 is currently in Phase 1b trials, with Phase 2 expected to commence in the second half of this year, and shows potential for treating heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). Ruth Gimeno, VP of Diabetes and Metabolic Research at Eli Lilly, stated that VERVE-102 has the potential to become the first in-vivo gene editing therapy for a broad population, possibly transforming cardiovascular disease treatment from chronic management to a one-time cure. William Blair analysts anticipate that Eli Lilly will likely restructure the original licensing agreement.
Eli Lilly has been aggressive with acquisitions this year. Besides Verve, it acquired Scorpion Therapeutics' PI3Kα pipeline for US$2.5 billion earlier in the year, and last month, it acquired SiteOne Therapeutics for up to US$1 billion, adding SiteOne's non-opioid painkiller, soon entering Phase 2 trials, to its portfolio. The acquisition news also stimulated the broader gene editing stock market, with shares of Intellia Therapeutics, Beam Therapeutics, and Editas Medicines all rising in pre-market trading.",2025-09-03 08:36:16

試驗數據顯示，TAH3311在空腹條件下的藥物動力學指標Cmax和AUC與歐美原廠Apixaban錠劑符合生體相等性(BE)的法定標準。泰合生技強調，對於需要終生服藥且吞嚥困難的患者，目前將Apixaban錠劑研磨成粉並與水混合的傳統方式，不僅費時、劑量不精準，更增加噎嗆及吸入性肺炎的風險；TAH3311則無需配水即可快速置於舌上溶解，大幅提升用藥便利性並減輕患者及照顧者負擔。

泰合生技預計TAH3311若能如期取得藥證，將有機會搶先與原廠藥競爭，並正積極尋求全球合作夥伴以加速國際市場布局。公司以其TDS平台技術，持續開發多種新劑型藥物，包括已在日本上市銷售的TAH4411化療止吐口溶膜、授權給合作夥伴於美國開發的TAH9922過動症口服液，以及其他如鴉片解毒劑口頰溶膜等進入臨床一期試驗的產品。泰合生技也已承接兩家國際生技藥廠的委託開發案，顯示其技術實力獲得業界肯定。","On June 18, 2025 (US time), Taiahem Biotech (6467) announced the successful completion of the pivotal trial for its TAH3311 Apixaban antithrombotic oral dissolving film at the 2025 BIO conference in Boston, USA. TAH3311 leverages Taiahem Biotech's proprietary Transepithelial Delivery System (TDS) to transform Apixaban, a globally top-selling anticoagulant, into an oral dissolving film (ODF). This innovative 505(b)(2) new drug application for a new dosage form aims to address the unmet clinical need of patients with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).

Trial results demonstrated that TAH3311 met the bioequivalence (BE) regulatory standards, with pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC comparing favorably to the original Apixaban tablets from Europe and the US under fasting conditions. Taiahem Biotech highlighted that the current practice of crushing Apixaban tablets for dysphagic patients is time-consuming, prone to inaccurate dosing, and carries risks of choking and aspiration pneumonia.

ARD103 is a novel cell therapy intended for the rare disease Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The first patient (first-patient-in) received the CAR-T infusion at Novant Health Cancer Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. Kuan Chien-Tsun, General Manager of ARCE Therapeutics, stated that the ARD103 Phase 1/2 trial received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval last October. This multi-center, open-label trial in the US is recruiting patients with relapsed/refractory AML (r/r AML). Phase 1 aims to enroll 12-18 patients to assess safety and tolerability, define the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), and concurrently evaluate ARD103's efficacy. The entire Phase 1/2 trial is projected to enroll a total of 49 patients. Kuan Chien-Tsun emphasized that ARD103 was developed in just four and a half years and has already secured FDA orphan drug designation for r/r AML. The successful infusion of the first patient marks a significant milestone for ARD103, positioning it as a potential first-in-class cell therapy for r/r AML. The article notes that while approximately 60% of AML patients achieve complete remission with standard chemotherapy, 40-80% experience relapse due to residual leukemia stem cells, with subsequent treatments showing poor efficacy. ARD103 is therefore a promising new treatment option for relapsed AML.",2025-09-03 08:39:22

In a Phase 1b trial involving 10 patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after first-line treatment, JNJ-4496 achieved a 100% objective response rate (ORR), with 8 patients reaching complete response (CR) with no detectable signs of cancer. Furthermore, in a cohort of 12 patients who had received two or more prior therapies, the ORR and CR were 92% and 75% respectively. Analysts from Truist Securities noted that JNJ-4496 has the potential to challenge Yescarta, a standard-of-care CAR-T therapy currently marketed by Gilead Sciences. While efficacy is strong, safety data showed that 84% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, with 28% having serious side effects. However, no Grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed. JNJ-4496 is one of two CAR-T therapies J&J acquired in 2023 for an upfront payment of $245 million from Shanghai-based Cellular Biomedicine Group (now AbelZeta Pharma). This acquisition signifies J&J's continued aggressive expansion into the CAR-T space, following the approval of Carvykti, developed in collaboration with Legend Biotech, in 2022. This strategy addresses the strong competition from companies like Novartis, Gilead, and AstraZeneca in the CAR-T cell therapy market. However, the cell therapy sector has recently seen a slowdown due to high costs and clinical challenges, with startups like Carisma Therapeutics and Vor Bio announcing closures, and CAR-T company Cargo Therapeutics selling all assets and laying off 90% of its staff earlier this year.",2025-09-03 08:39:07

再生元製藥原本於5月19日被報導將以2.56億美元收購23andMe及其資產，並計畫將其作為子公司營運，繼續提供消費者檢測服務。然而，Wojcicki透過TTAM提出更高報價，並承諾將維持23andMe的消費者基因體服務和隱私政策，同時計劃採取新的資料保護措施，確保用戶有權利選擇如何處理自己的基因數據，並將來即使所有權再次變更，新買家也需遵守相同的隱私政策。

23andMe曾是市場上紅極一時的基因科技公司，但自2021年透過SPAC上市後，股價大幅蒸發，並於2024年停止抗癌藥物研究、裁員，最終在今年3月申請破產，Wojcicki也隨之辭去執行長職務。儘管公司面臨困境，Wojcicki仍致力於回購公司，她這次的3.05億美元出價，遠高於去年夏天她曾提出但遭拒絕的約7,400萬美元私有化報價，顯示其為保護公司使命和用戶數據所做的努力。23andMe董事會主席Mark Jensen對此結果表示肯定，認為此舉為利害關係人帶來更高價值，同時強化了用戶隱私與數據保護。","The fate of the bankrupt gene technology company 23andMe took a turn, as former CEO Anne Wojcicki, through her newly established non-profit medical research organization ""TTAM Research Institute,"" successfully outbid Regeneron at a bankruptcy auction on June 16th with a $305 million offer. This surpassed Regeneron's previous bid of $256 million, allowing TTAM to acquire 23andMe's vast consumer and biotech R&D genetic database. The transaction is pending final court approval, scheduled for June 17th.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals was initially reported on May 19th to acquire 23andMe and most of its assets, including its R&D services, biobank, and DNA database, with plans to operate it as a subsidiary and continue its consumer testing services. However, Wojcicki's higher offer via TTAM Research Institute prevailed. TTAM has pledged to maintain 23andMe's consumer genomics services and privacy policies, and plans to implement new data protection measures to ensure users retain control over their genetic data. It also stipulates that any future change in ownership or control, including another bankruptcy, would require the new buyer to adopt the same privacy policies.

23andMe was once a prominent gene technology company, but its stock value plummeted by over 97% since its $3.5 billion SPAC listing in early 2021. In 2024, it halted its anti-cancer drug research program, laid off 40% of its staff, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, leading to Wojcicki's resignation as CEO. Despite its struggles, Wojcicki remained committed to the company, with her $305 million winning bid significantly higher than her approximately $74 million privatization offer rejected last summer. 23andMe's board chairman, Mark Jensen, expressed satisfaction with the outcome, highlighting the enhanced value for stakeholders and strengthened user privacy and data protection.",2025-09-03 08:38:53

They successfully created mice carrying human cells by injecting pre-cultivated human intestinal, liver, and brain organoids into the amniotic fluid of pregnant mice. A small number of human cells were found in the intestines, liver, and brains of these mice, with human cells making up about 1% of the total intestinal cells. These cells remained stable and functional for at least two months after birth, with human liver cells, for instance, producing human albumin. This technique offers a novel solution to previous challenges in human-animal chimera research, such as low human cell survival rates, short survival times, and difficulty controlling differentiation, potentially leading to the future development of human organs for transplantation. Although this research has not yet undergone peer review, the relevant data was first presented on June 12 at the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) annual meeting in Hong Kong. The research team also acknowledged the ethical concerns surrounding injecting human cells into the brains of other animals, particularly the potential for mice to develop human-like cognitive abilities if the proportion of human tissue increases in the future, a matter requiring careful consideration.",2025-09-03 08:38:39

BioNTech因與輝瑞合作開發新冠疫苗Comirnaty而聲名大噪，正積極轉型為「全方位整合型免疫療法公司」。該公司預計今年下半年提交從中國DaulityBio授權的下一代HER2靶向抗體藥物偶聯物(ADC)的上市申請，並正推進包括PD-L1×VEGF雙特異性抗體BNT327在內的兩項腫瘤學產品研發計畫。

CureVac曾是COVID-19疫情期間最早投入疫苗開發的公司之一，自2020年起與葛蘭素史克(GSK)合作開發次世代mRNA疫苗平台。然而，其第一代COVID-19疫苗CVnCoV因臨床三期試驗未達主要保護效益而停擺。為調整研發重心，CureVac於去年將該疫苗相關權利以15億歐元出售予GSK，並將策略轉向腫瘤學領域，同時進行組織重整以優化資源配置。值得注意的是，CureVac曾於2022年向德國法院控告BioNTech與輝瑞侵犯其新冠mRNA疫苗專利，該案目前仍在審理中。隨著CureVac被BioNTech併購，此專利戰是否將因併購案而出現轉折或和解契機，備受各界關注。","On June 12th, US time, German biotech giant BioNTech announced its acquisition of fellow German mRNA vaccine developer CureVac in an all-stock transaction valued at $1.25 billion. This acquisition is intended to significantly bolster BioNTech's capabilities in mRNA design, delivery technology, and manufacturing, while also expanding its research, development, production, and commercialization efforts in mRNA cancer immunotherapy. The deal is considered a major integration milestone for the European mRNA industry. Under the terms of the agreement, CureVac shareholders will receive BioNTech American Depositary Shares (ADSs) at approximately $5.46 per common share, and are expected to hold between 4% and 6% of BioNTech's shares upon completion, with CureVac becoming a BioNTech subsidiary.

BioNTech, renowned for its collaboration with Pfizer on the blockbuster COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty, is actively transforming into a ""fully integrated immunotherapy company."" The company plans to submit a marketing application for a next-generation HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) licensed from China's DaulityBio in the second half of this year, alongside advancing two oncology programs, including the PD-L1×VEGF bispecific antibody BNT327.

CureVac was an early entrant in COVID-19 vaccine development, having partnered with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) since 2020 on next-generation mRNA vaccines. However, its first-generation COVID-19 vaccine, CVnCoV, was discontinued after failing to meet primary efficacy endpoints in Phase 3 trials. To realign its R&D focus, CureVac sold the related rights to GSK for 1.5 billion euros last year, pivoting its strategy towards oncology and undergoing organizational restructuring to optimize resources. Notably, CureVac filed a lawsuit in 2022 accusing BioNTech and Pfizer of infringing its mRNA vaccine patents, a case that remains ongoing. With CureVac's acquisition by BioNTech, there is considerable interest in whether this patent dispute will see a turning point or settlement opportunity.",2025-09-03 08:45:05

禮來看準GLP-1類減重藥物廣泛應用後，使用者常面臨瘦肉組織流失問題，因此投入增肌藥物研發，以維持患者肌肉量。Juvena的AI平台擅長篩選分泌再生分子蛋白，已開發出融合蛋白JUV-161，並已啟動治療肌肉失養症的人體試驗。
目前，禮來與諾和諾德（Novo Nordisk）主導減重市場，而羅氏（Roche）、再生元（Regeneron）及Scholar Rock等藥廠也紛紛鎖定「保存肌肉」作為差異化切入點。例如，羅氏以27億美元收購Carmot Therapeutics佈局肥胖療法；再生元則斥資8000萬美元與中國翰森製藥合作開發GLP-1/GIP雙靶點藥物，搭配其肌肉藥物，擴展肥胖治療組合，顯示增肌與體重管理結合已成為產業新趨勢。","Eli Lilly recently announced a partnership with chronic degenerative disease startup Juvena Therapeutics, involving an investment of over $650 million. The collaboration aims to leverage Juvena's AI platform, JuvNET, to develop drug candidates that can mitigate muscle mass loss following weight reduction. This move further expands Eli Lilly's weight management portfolio, following its acquisition of Versanis Bio for bimagrumab in 2023 and a recent partnership with Sweden's Camurus for long-acting drug delivery technology.
Eli Lilly's strategy targets the emerging demand for muscle-preserving drugs in the wake of widespread GLP-1 medication use, which often leads to lean tissue loss among users. Juvena's proprietary AI-driven platform excels at screening secreted regenerative protein molecules and has already developed the fusion protein JUV-161, which has entered human trials for myotonic dystrophy.
While Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk currently dominate the weight loss market, competitors like Roche, Regeneron, and Scholar Rock are also focusing on ""muscle preservation"" as a differentiating factor. Roche, for instance, acquired Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion to bolster its obesity therapies, while Regeneron invested $80 million in a partnership with China's Hansoh Pharmaceuticals for a GLP-1/GIP dual-target receptor agonist, complementing its existing muscle drugs. This trend underscores the industry's shift towards integrated weight management solutions that prioritize muscle maintenance.",2025-09-03 08:44:51

This system marks the first time an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patient, whose ability to speak was severely impaired, could not only vocalize words but also express emotions and hum melodies. The BCI system utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to decode electrophysiological brain signals generated when a patient attempts to speak, enabling real-time reproduction of intended words, complete with simulated intonation, pitch, and accent to convey meaning and emotion. A significant breakthrough is its speed: the system generates synthesized speech within just 10 milliseconds of the brain's intention to speak, dramatically reducing the latency compared to previous BCI systems which typically had a 3-second delay or required users to complete an entire sentence before vocalization. For the study, a 45-year-old male ALS patient, five years after symptom onset, underwent surgery to implant 256 1.5mm silicon electrodes in his brain's motor control area. Deep learning algorithms were then employed to capture and analyze brain signals every 10 milliseconds, decoding the patient's *attempted sounds* rather than just pre-defined words or phonemes. This allows the system to operate without vocabulary limitations, facilitating the expression of interjections and exclamations. Furthermore, the AI was trained using the patient's pre-illness interview recordings to create a synthetic voice that closely mimics his original voice, which the patient found 'happy' and 'like his real voice'. Testing demonstrated the system's ability for the patient to spell words, answer open-ended questions, and even create new words, highlighting its flexibility. The BCI also distinguished between interrogative and declarative sentences, adjusting speech intonation and stress in real-time. Silvia Marchesotti, a neuroengineer from the University of Geneva, lauded the research as a 'paradigm shift,' envisioning its potential for developing practical, daily-use BCI speech assistance devices that could significantly enhance patient acceptance and application potential.",2025-09-03 08:44:35

The study, involving 50 healthy seniors (average age 66), tested language comprehension through a semantic classification task while recording N400 brainwave responses. Findings indicate that even without overt cognitive decline, highly lonely seniors exhibit N400 brainwave reactions to atypical words that are similar to those for incorrect words, suggesting impaired semantic recognition and processing. These subtle difficulties in language comprehension and the observed brainwave features are consistent with neural indicators previously seen in early-stage dementia patients.

合一總經理鄭淑玲表示，Bonvadis經過三年三階段申請，已取得各類急慢性傷口的美國上市許可。此前，Bonvadis最早於2022年8月通過FDA 510(k)醫材實質等同性認定，獲准用於急性傷口；2024年5月再獲FDA 510(k)核准用於部分皮層傷口、手術縫合後傷口、1級與淺表2級燒傷。

ON101產品線採取「藥品與醫材雙管道策略」。新藥方面以Fespixon為名，已取得台灣、新加坡、馬來西亞與中國的藥證；醫材Bonvadis則已取得美國、印度、紐西蘭、南非、泰國等國急性傷口適應症的上市許可，歐盟則取得疤痕適應症醫材上市許可。

近期，Fespixon新藥以其顯著臨床療效在藥事經濟學分析中，顯示在新加坡醫療情境下具有成本節約優勢，此研究已獲國際知名SCI期刊《Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism》發表。該分析針對新加坡糖尿病足部潰瘍(DFU)病患進行成本效益評估，結果顯示Fespixon治療組不僅可提升病患生活品質（QALY增加0.15），更能在五年內平均為每位病患節省約16,237美元的醫療成本。在高風險亞群中，節省幅度更高。

鄭淑玲進一步解釋ON101的作用機轉，其透過減少發炎性M1型巨噬細胞，改善傷口局部免疫環境，同時刺激脂肪前驅細胞分泌GCSF及CXCL3兩種細胞素，增加修復型M2a/M2c巨噬細胞，調節膠原蛋白生成，促進傷口完全癒合。臨床三期試驗結果顯示，患者16週完全癒合率高達60.7%。","PharmaEssentia (4743) announced on June 10 that its Bonvadis (ON101) cream has received its third approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This latest approval expands its indication to include full-thickness chronic wounds, encompassing full-thickness and partial-thickness wounds, post-surgical wounds, first and superficial second-degree burns, as well as diabetic foot ulcers, venous ulcers, and pressure ulcers. The company plans to continue its international market sales and promotion. This positive news led to PharmaEssentia's stock price hitting its daily limit today, rising 9.90% to NT$63.3.

According to PharmaEssentia General Manager Shu-Ling Cheng, Bonvadis has obtained U.S. market approval for various acute and chronic wound indications after a three-year, three-phase application process. Previously, Bonvadis first received FDA 510(k) clearance for acute wounds in August 2022, and in May 2024, it received another FDA 510(k) approval for partial-thickness wounds, post-surgical wounds, and first and superficial second-degree burns.

The ON101 product line employs a dual strategy of both new drug and medical device. The new drug, named Fespixon, has obtained drug licenses in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and China. The medical device, Bonvadis, has secured market approval for acute wound indications in the U.S., India, New Zealand, South Africa, and Thailand, while in the EU, it has received market approval for scar indications.

Recently, the Fespixon new drug's significant clinical efficacy demonstrated cost-saving advantages in a pharmacoeconomic analysis within the Singapore healthcare setting. This study has been published in the internationally renowned SCI journal *Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism*. The cost-effectiveness analysis for Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) patients in Singapore showed that the Fespixon treatment group not only improved patients' quality of life (QALY increased by 0.15) but also saved an average of approximately US$16,237 in medical costs per patient over five years, with even greater savings in high-risk subgroups.

Cheng further elaborated on ON101's mechanism of action: it reduces inflammatory M1-type macrophages, improving the local immune environment of the wound. Simultaneously, it stimulates adipocyte precursor cells to secrete two cytokines, GCSF and CXCL3, increasing reparative M2a/M2c macrophages, regulating collagen production, and promoting complete wound healing.

This technology overcomes the traditional optical microscope's diffraction limit and the electron microscope's inability to observe living samples or retain fluorescence. KExM employs a highly absorbent polymer, potassium polyacrylate (KA), to uniformly expand biological samples by up to 64,000 times in volume, making nanoscale structures visible under an optical microscope. This is then combined with Bessel light-sheet microscopy for rapid, low-photobleaching 3D imaging. The innovation achieves a remarkable resolution of approximately 10 nanometers, allowing scientists to perform 3D imaging of entire Drosophila brains, identify minute synapses between nerve cells, and visualize synaptic scaffold proteins and synaptic vesicles, all while preserving multi-color fluorescence. Published in ""Nature Communications,"" this technique provides high-resolution, large-scale ""brain structural maps,"" crucial for understanding mechanisms of memory, learning, and neurological diseases. It also holds potential for expansion to other biological samples, such as mouse brains and human tissues, fostering continuous breakthroughs in basic and applied sciences.",2025-09-03 08:49:06

董事長郭旭崧表示，儘管去年因新藥研發投入呈現虧損，但在次世代細胞醫療產品開發與國際合作上取得重大進展。今年將加速轉型升級，加速調節型T細胞療法的臨床收案進度，並啟動美國投資計畫。旗下新藥TRK-001已完成製程優化，並獲美國FDA與TFDA核准啟動臨床二期試驗。此外，與美國哈佛大學合作建立了濾泡調節型T細胞的大數據資料庫，並篩選出潛力基因修飾候選基因。

今年5月，台寶生醫與梅約醫學中心簽署合作意向書，雙方將在美國鳳凰城共同打造創新園區，專注於次世代細胞治療製程技術的研發，結合台寶的短製程平台FAST CGT。執行長楊鈞堯指出，公司新藥開發重心將轉移至調節型T細胞，並導入基因修飾，而原有的間葉幹細胞產品則暫緩收案或採取授權方式。其中，治療退化性關節炎新藥Chondrochymal®已授權新加坡Senectus公司，並獲TFDA有條件同意進行臨床三期試驗，後續將由Senectus負責開發與東南亞藥證布局，台寶生醫將以固定價格向其提供臨床用藥。

楊鈞堯強調，今年將調整產品組合、加速臨床收案，全力推進TRK-001的臨床二期試驗收案，目標於收案完成後一年取得初步療效數據，並爭取再生醫療先進療法(RMAT)資格，以期提早上市。此外，台寶生醫將推動TDM新商業模式，透過高度自動化與標準化的短製程平台，提供低成本、短週期、高效率的優勢，預期將帶動營收連年創高。","TaiMed Biologics (台寶生醫, stock code 6892) held its annual general meeting today, approving a private placement for a capital increase of up to 30,000 shares and accepting its 2024 business report and financial statements. The company reported a record-high consolidated revenue of NT$105 million last year, driven by the steady growth of its Therapeutics Design and Manufacturing (TDM) business. In new drug development, TaiMed Biologics is focusing on the clinical advancement of mesenchymal stem cells and the international expansion of next-generation regulatory T-cell therapies. Increased R&D investment led to a loss per share of NT$4.81 last year.

Chairman Hsung-Shang Kuo stated that despite the loss due to significant R&D spending on new drug development, the company has made substantial progress in next-generation cell therapy product development and international collaborations. This year, TaiMed Biologics plans to accelerate its transformation and upgrade, speeding up patient enrollment for regulatory T-cell therapies, and initiating investment plans in the US to establish advanced manufacturing capabilities. Its new drug TRK-001 has completed process optimization and received approval from both the US FDA and TFDA to commence Phase II clinical trials. Furthermore, a research collaboration with Harvard University has yielded preliminary results, establishing a big data database for follicular regulatory T cells and identifying potential gene-modified candidate genes.

In May, TaiMed Biologics signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Mayo Clinic, with plans to jointly build an innovation park in Phoenix, USA. This park will focus on the R&D of next-generation cell therapy manufacturing process technologies, integrating TaiMed's proprietary short-process platform FAST CGT. CEO Chun-Yao Yang indicated that the company's new drug development focus will shift to regulatory T cells, incorporating gene modification to enhance their efficacy. Existing mesenchymal stem cell products will temporarily halt enrollment or be licensed out for investment recovery. Specifically, its new drug for osteoarthritis, Chondrochymal®, has been licensed to Singaporean company Senectus and conditionally approved by TFDA for Phase III clinical trials. Senectus will subsequently handle its development and regulatory filings in Southeast Asian markets, bearing the related clinical costs. TaiMed Biologics will supply clinical drugs to Senectus at a fixed price upon enrollment.

Yang emphasized that this year's priorities include adjusting the product portfolio and accelerating clinical enrollment. The company will fully advance patient enrollment for TRK-001's Phase II trial, aiming to obtain preliminary efficacy data within one year of enrollment completion, and seek Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for an earlier market launch. Additionally, TaiMed Biologics is promoting a new TDM business model, building a comprehensive ""needle to needle"" treatment process and integrating its core short-process platform for highly automated and standardized manufacturing. This model offers advantages such as lower technology transfer barriers, reduced costs, shorter cycles, and higher efficiency, expected to drive continuous revenue growth and assist multiple products from preclinical to Phase I.",2025-09-03 08:48:56

The company plans to close six underutilized U.S. manufacturing sites—located in Bedford, Allston, and Marlborough, Massachusetts; San Diego and Fremont, California; and Alachua, Florida—through a newly established legal entity as part of a business restructuring. A company spokesperson confirmed the move, emphasizing that other operations will continue normally, with resources concentrated on high-growth areas. CEO William Marth acknowledged that the company's expansion outpaced industry demand, and this restructuring is a direct response to excess capacity and an industry downturn in the biotech market. National Resilience will focus on high-growth segments like cell therapy, biologics, and sterile injectables, with its West Chester, Ohio, and Toronto, Canada facilities remaining unaffected and performing well. The company has secured $250 million in interim financing from existing shareholders and plans to seek additional debt financing for long-term growth. Significantly, Taiwan Bio-Manufacturing Company (TBMC) saw National Resilience's stake increase to 35.4% following a capital increase in February, making it TBMC's largest shareholder, surpassing the National Development Fund. With National Resilience's bankruptcy filing, the fate of TBMC's substantial stake and the potential impact on its ability to introduce innovative biotechnical capabilities are now major concerns, prompting calls for TBMC to provide a prompt public explanation. National Resilience has faced multiple layoffs and operational adjustments in recent years due to industry decline, including selling and leasing back factories for fundraising, and significant workforce reductions in Boston, Florida, and North Carolina.",2025-09-03 08:48:30

Their study analyzes the complex interplay between skin stem cells, cancer stem cells, and their niche microenvironment, while also reviewing new advancements in clinical trials and drug development targeting specific signaling pathways. This research provides new insights for related studies and clinical strategies in skin cancer. The study highlights that the niche microenvironment plays a critical role in regulating the cell fate of both normal skin stem cells (SSCs) and skin cancer stem cells. Theoretically, targeting the cancer stem cell niche could be an effective therapeutic strategy. However, the dual effects of shared niche signaling pathways between cancer stem cells and normal skin stem cells in skin cancer patients contribute to tumor aggressiveness and reduce patient survival rates. The current insufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms hinders the development of effective therapies. In this research, the team delved into how niche factors regulate cell fate towards either skin stem cells or cancer stem cells, and their clinical significance. They discovered that adhesive molecules within the niche are crucial for normal epithelial differentiation, but their overexpression or aberrant expression can lead to the expansion of cancer stem cells. Furthermore, various key components of the adhesive niche, including the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ), adherens junctions between epithelial cells, and cell types like immune cells and fibroblasts, as well as major signaling pathways such as Shh, Wnt/β-catenin, YAP/TAZ, and Notch, all play dual roles. These are vital for maintaining the growth balance of skin stem cells, but excessive activation could promote skin cancer progression and the generation of cancer stem cells. The research team believes that developing therapies specifically targeting these signaling pathways could offer new hope for skin cancer patients with cancer stem cells or drug resistance. However, they also emphasize that the precise relationship between cancer stem cells and their microenvironment in the skin requires further investigation.",2025-09-03 08:51:20
